{\MT The Second Book of Moses, called Exodus

\par }\ChapOne{1}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now these
{\ADD{are}} the
names of the
children of
Israel, which
came into
Egypt; every
man and his
household
came with
Jacob.
\VS{2}Reuben,
Simeon,
Levi, and
Judah,
\VS{3}Issachar,
Zebulun, and
Benjamin,
\VS{4}Dan, and
Naphtali,
Gad, and
Asher.
\VS{5}And all the
souls that came
out of the
loins of
Jacob were
seventy
souls: for
Joseph was in
Egypt
{\ADD{already}}.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 1.5 }
loins: Heb. thigh}
\VS{6}And
Joseph
died, and all his
brethren, and all that
generation.
\par }{\PP \VS{7}¶ And the
children of
Israel were
fruitful, and increased
abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed
exceeding
mighty; and the
land was
filled with them.
\par }{\PP \VS{8}Now there arose
up a
new
king over
Egypt, which
knew not
Joseph.
\VS{9}And he
said unto his
people, Behold, the
people of the
children of
Israel
{\ADD{are}}
more and
mightier than we:
\VS{10}Come
on, let us deal
wisely with them; lest they
multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth
out any
war,
they
join also unto our
enemies, and
fight against us, and
{\ADD{so}} get them
up out of the
land.
\VS{11}Therefore they did
set over them
taskmasters to
afflict them with their
burdens. And they
built for
Pharaoh
treasure
cities,
Pithom and
Raamses.
\VS{12}But the more they
afflicted them, the
more they
multiplied and
grew. And they were
grieved
because of the
children of
Israel.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 1.12 }
But…: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc}
\VS{13}And the
Egyptians
made the
children of
Israel to
serve with
rigour:
\VS{14}And they
made their
lives
bitter with
hard
bondage, in
morter, and in
brick, and in all manner of
service in the
field: all their
service, wherein they made them
serve,
{\ADD{was}} with
rigour.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}¶ And the
king of
Egypt
spake to the
Hebrew
midwives, of which the
name of the
one
{\ADD{was}}
Shiphrah, and the
name of the
other
Puah:
\VS{16}And he
said, When ye do the office of a
midwife to the Hebrew
women, and
see
{\ADD{them}} upon the
stools; if it
{\ADD{be}} a
son, then ye shall
kill him: but if it
{\ADD{be}} a
daughter, then she shall
live.
\VS{17}But the
midwives
feared
God, and
did not as the
king of
Egypt
commanded them, but
saved the men
children
alive.
\VS{18}And the
king of
Egypt
called for the
midwives, and
said unto them,
Why have ye
done this
thing, and have
saved the men
children
alive?
\VS{19}And the
midwives
said unto
Pharaoh, Because the
Hebrew
women
{\ADD{are}} not as the Egyptian
women; for they
{\ADD{are}}
lively, and are
delivered
ere the
midwives come
in unto them.
\VS{20}Therefore
God dealt
well with the
midwives: and the
people
multiplied, and waxed
very
mighty.
\VS{21}And it came to pass, because the
midwives
feared
God, that he
made them
houses.
\VS{22}And
Pharaoh
charged all his
people,
saying, Every
son that is
born ye shall
cast into the
river, and every
daughter ye shall save
alive.

\par }\Chap{2}{\PP \VerseOne{1}And there
went a
man of the
house of
Levi, and
took
{\ADD{to wife}} a
daughter of
Levi.
\VS{2}And the
woman
conceived, and
bare a
son: and when she
saw him that he
{\ADD{was a}}
goodly
{\ADD{child}}, she
hid him
three
months.
\VS{3}And when she
could not
longer
hide him, she
took for him an
ark of
bulrushes, and
daubed it with
slime and with
pitch, and
put the
child therein; and she
laid
{\ADD{it}} in the
flags by the
river’s
brink.
\VS{4}And his
sister
stood afar
off, to
wit what would be
done to him.
\par }{\PP \VS{5}¶ And the
daughter of
Pharaoh came
down to
wash
{\ADD{herself}} at the
river; and her
maidens
walked along by the
river’s
side; and when she
saw the
ark
among the
flags, she
sent her
maid to
fetch it.
\VS{6}And when she had
opened
{\ADD{it}}, she
saw the
child: and, behold, the
babe
wept. And she had
compassion on him, and
said, This
{\ADD{is one}} of the
Hebrews’
children.
\VS{7}Then
said his
sister to
Pharaoh’s
daughter, Shall I
go and
call to thee a
nurse of the
Hebrew
women, that she may
nurse the
child for thee?
\VS{8}And
Pharaoh’s
daughter
said to her,
Go. And the
maid
went and
called the
child’s
mother.
\VS{9}And
Pharaoh’s
daughter
said unto her,
Take this
child
away, and
nurse it for me, and I will
give
{\ADD{thee}} thy
wages. And the
woman
took the
child, and
nursed it.
\VS{10}And the
child
grew, and she
brought him unto
Pharaoh’s
daughter, and he became her
son. And she
called his
name
Moses: and she
said, Because I
drew him out of the
water.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 2.10 }
Moses: that is, Drawn out}
\par }{\PP \VS{11}¶ And it came to pass in those
days, when
Moses was
grown, that he went
out unto his
brethren, and
looked on their
burdens: and he
spied an
Egyptian
smiting an
Hebrew, one of his
brethren.
\VS{12}And he
looked this
way and that
way, and when he
saw that
{\ADD{there was}} no
man, he
slew the
Egyptian, and
hid him in the
sand.
\VS{13}And when he went
out the
second
day, behold,
two
men of the
Hebrews
strove together: and he
said to him that did the
wrong, Wherefore
smitest thou thy
fellow?
\VS{14}And he
said, Who
made
thee a
prince and a
judge over us?
intendest thou to
kill me, as thou
killedst the
Egyptian? And
Moses
feared, and
said,
Surely this
thing is
known.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 2.14 }
a prince: Heb. a man, a prince}
\VS{15}Now when
Pharaoh
heard this
thing, he
sought to
slay
Moses. But
Moses
fled from the
face of
Pharaoh, and
dwelt in the
land of
Midian: and he sat
down by a
well.
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Now the
priest of
Midian had
seven
daughters: and they
came and
drew
{\ADD{water}}, and
filled the
troughs to
water their
father’s
flock.\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 2.16 }
priest: or, prince}
\VS{17}And the
shepherds
came and drove them
away: but
Moses stood
up and
helped them, and
watered their
flock.
\VS{18}And when they
came to
Reuel their
father, he
said,
How
{\ADD{is it that}} ye are
come so
soon to
day?\FTNT{§}{{\FR 2.18 }
Reuel: called also Jethro, or, Jether}
\VS{19}And they
said, An
Egyptian
delivered us out of the
hand of the
shepherds, and also
drew
{\ADD{water}}
enough for us, and
watered the
flock.
\VS{20}And he
said unto his
daughters, And where
{\ADD{is}} he? why
{\ADD{is}} it
{\ADD{that}} ye have
left the
man?
call him, that he may
eat
bread.
\VS{21}And
Moses was
content to
dwell with the
man: and he
gave
Moses
Zipporah his
daughter.
\VS{22}And she
bare
{\ADD{him}} a
son, and he
called his
name
Gershom: for he
said, I have been a
stranger in a
strange
land.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 2.22 }
Gershom: that is, A stranger here}
\par }{\PP \VS{23}¶ And it came to pass in
process of
time, that the
king of
Egypt
died: and the
children of
Israel
sighed by reason
of the
bondage, and they
cried, and their
cry came
up unto
God by reason of the
bondage.
\VS{24}And
God
heard their
groaning, and
God
remembered his
covenant with
Abraham, with
Isaac, and with
Jacob.
\VS{25}And
God
looked upon the
children of
Israel, and
God had
respect unto
{\ADD{them}}.\FTNT{††}{{\FR 2.25 }
had…: Heb. knew}

\par }\Chap{3}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now
Moses
kept the
flock of
Jethro his father in
law, the
priest of
Midian: and he
led the
flock to the
backside of the
desert, and
came to the
mountain of
God,
{\ADD{even}} to
Horeb.
\VS{2}And the
angel of the
{\ND{
LORD}}
appeared unto him in a
flame of
fire out of the
midst of a
bush: and he
looked, and, behold, the
bush
burned with
fire, and the
bush
{\ADD{was}} not
consumed.
\VS{3}And
Moses
said, I will now turn
aside, and
see this
great
sight,
why the
bush is not
burnt.
\VS{4}And when the
{\ND{
LORD}}
saw that he turned
aside to
see,
God
called unto him out of the
midst of the
bush, and
said,
Moses,
Moses. And he
said, Here
{\ADD{am}} I.
\VS{5}And he
said, Draw not
nigh
hither: put
off thy
shoes from off thy
feet, for the
place
whereon thou
standest
{\ADD{is}}
holy
ground.
\VS{6}Moreover he
said, I
{\ADD{am}} the
God of thy
father, the
God of
Abraham, the
God of
Isaac, and the
God of
Jacob. And
Moses
hid his
face; for he was
afraid to
look upon
God.
\par }{\PP \VS{7}¶ And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said, I have
surely
seen the
affliction of my
people which
{\ADD{are}} in
Egypt, and have
heard their
cry by
reason of their
taskmasters; for I
know their
sorrows;
\VS{8}And I am come
down to
deliver them out of the
hand of the
Egyptians, and to
bring them up out of that
land unto a
good
land and a
large, unto a
land
flowing with
milk and
honey; unto the
place of the
Canaanites, and the
Hittites, and the
Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the
Hivites, and the
Jebusites.
\VS{9}Now therefore, behold, the
cry of the
children of
Israel is
come unto me: and I have also
seen the
oppression wherewith the
Egyptians
oppress them.
\VS{10}Come now therefore, and I will
send thee unto
Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring
forth my
people the
children of
Israel out of
Egypt.
\par }{\PP \VS{11}¶ And
Moses
said unto
God, Who
{\ADD{am}} I, that I should
go unto
Pharaoh, and that I should bring
forth the
children of
Israel out of
Egypt?
\VS{12}And he
said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this
{\ADD{shall be}} a
token unto thee,
that I have
sent thee: When thou hast brought
forth the
people out of
Egypt, ye shall
serve
God upon this
mountain.
\VS{13}And
Moses
said unto
God, Behold,
{\ADD{when}} I
come unto the
children of
Israel, and shall
say unto them, The
God of your
fathers hath
sent me unto you; and they shall
say to me, What
{\ADD{is}} his
name? what shall I
say unto them?
\VS{14}And
God
said unto
Moses, I
AM THAT I
AM: and he
said, Thus shalt thou
say unto the
children of
Israel, I AM hath
sent me unto you.
\VS{15}And
God
said
moreover unto
Moses, Thus shalt thou
say unto the
children of
Israel, The
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of your
fathers, the
God of
Abraham, the
God of
Isaac, and the
God of
Jacob, hath
sent me unto you: this
{\ADD{is}} my
name for
ever, and this
{\ADD{is}} my
memorial unto
all
generations.
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Go, and
gather the
elders of
Israel
together, and
say unto them, The
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of your
fathers, the
God of
Abraham, of
Isaac, and of
Jacob,
appeared unto me,
saying, I have
surely
visited you, and
{\ADD{seen}} that which is
done to you in
Egypt:
\VS{17}And I have
said, I will
bring you up out of the
affliction of
Egypt unto the
land of the
Canaanites, and the
Hittites, and the
Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the
Hivites, and the
Jebusites, unto a
land
flowing with
milk and
honey.
\VS{18}And they shall
hearken to thy
voice: and thou shalt
come, thou and the
elders of
Israel, unto the
king of
Egypt, and ye shall
say unto him, The
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of the
Hebrews hath
met with us: and now let us
go, we beseech thee,
three
days’
journey into the
wilderness, that we may
sacrifice to the
{\ND{
LORD}} our
God.
\par }{\PP \VS{19}¶ And I am
sure that the
king of
Egypt will not
let you
go, no, not by a
mighty
hand.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 3.19 }
no…: or, but by strong hand}
\VS{20}And I will stretch
out my
hand, and
smite
Egypt with all my
wonders which I will
do in the
midst thereof: and
after that he will let you
go.
\VS{21}And I will
give this
people
favour in the
sight of the
Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye
go, ye shall not
go
empty:
\VS{22}But every
woman shall
borrow of her
neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her
house,
jewels of
silver, and
jewels of
gold, and
raiment: and ye shall
put
{\ADD{them}} upon your
sons, and upon your
daughters; and ye shall
spoil the
Egyptians.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 3.22 }
the Egyptians: or, Egypt}

\par }\Chap{4}{\PP \VerseOne{1}And
Moses
answered and
said, But, behold, they will not
believe me, nor
hearken unto my
voice: for they will
say, The
{\ND{
LORD}} hath not
appeared unto thee.
\VS{2}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said unto him, What
{\ADD{is}} that in thine
hand? And he
said, A
rod.
\VS{3}And he
said,
Cast it on the
ground. And he
cast it on the
ground, and it became a
serpent; and
Moses
fled from
before it.
\VS{4}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said unto
Moses, Put
forth thine
hand, and
take it by the
tail. And he put
forth his
hand, and
caught it, and it became a
rod in his
hand:
\VS{5}That they may
believe that the
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of their
fathers, the
God of
Abraham, the
God of
Isaac, and the
God of
Jacob, hath
appeared unto thee.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}¶ And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said
furthermore unto him,
Put now thine
hand into thy
bosom. And he
put his
hand into his
bosom: and when he
took it out, behold, his
hand
{\ADD{was}}
leprous as
snow.
\VS{7}And he
said,
Put thine
hand into thy
bosom
again. And he
put his
hand into his
bosom
again; and
plucked it out of his
bosom, and, behold, it was turned
again as his
{\ADD{other}}
flesh.
\VS{8}And it shall come to pass, if they will not
believe thee, neither
hearken to the
voice of the
first
sign, that they will
believe the
voice of the
latter
sign.
\VS{9}And it shall come to pass, if they will not
believe also these
two
signs, neither
hearken unto thy
voice, that thou shalt
take of the
water of the
river, and
pour
{\ADD{it}} upon the
dry
{\ADD{land:}} and the
water which thou
takest out of the
river shall become
blood upon the
dry
{\ADD{land}}.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 4.9 }
shall become: Heb. shall be and shall be}
\par }{\PP \VS{10}¶ And
Moses
said unto the
{\ND{
LORD}},
O my
Lord,
I
{\ADD{am}} not
eloquent, neither
heretofore, nor
since thou hast
spoken unto thy
servant: but I
{\ADD{am}}
slow of
speech, and of a
slow
tongue.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 4.10 }
eloquent: Heb. a man of words}\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 4.10 }
heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, nor since the third day}
\VS{11}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said unto him, Who hath
made
man’s
mouth? or who
maketh the
dumb, or
deaf, or the
seeing, or the
blind? have not I the
{\ND{
LORD}}?
\VS{12}Now therefore
go, and I will be with thy
mouth, and
teach thee what thou shalt
say.
\VS{13}And he
said,
O my
Lord,
send, I pray thee, by the
hand
{\ADD{of him whom}} thou wilt
send.\FTNT{§}{{\FR 4.13 }
wilt: or, shouldest}
\VS{14}And the
anger of the
{\ND{
LORD}} was
kindled against
Moses, and he
said,
{\ADD{Is}} not
Aaron the
Levite thy
brother? I
know that he can
speak
well. And also, behold, he cometh
forth to
meet thee: and when he
seeth thee, he will be
glad in his
heart.
\VS{15}And thou shalt
speak unto him, and
put
words in his
mouth: and I will be with thy
mouth, and with his
mouth, and will
teach you what ye shall
do.
\VS{16}And he shall be thy
spokesman unto the
people: and he shall be,
{\ADD{even}} he shall be to thee instead of a
mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of
God.
\VS{17}And thou shalt
take this
rod in thine
hand, wherewith thou shalt
do
signs.
\par }{\PP \VS{18}¶ And
Moses
went and
returned to
Jethro his father in
law, and
said unto him, Let me
go, I pray thee, and
return unto my
brethren which
{\ADD{are}} in
Egypt, and
see whether they be
yet
alive. And
Jethro
said to
Moses,
Go in
peace.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 4.18 }
Jethro: Heb. Jether}
\VS{19}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said unto
Moses in
Midian,
Go,
return into
Egypt: for all the
men are
dead which
sought thy
life.
\VS{20}And
Moses
took his
wife and his
sons, and
set them upon an
ass, and he
returned to the
land of
Egypt: and
Moses
took the
rod of
God in his
hand.
\VS{21}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said unto
Moses, When thou
goest to
return into
Egypt,
see that thou
do all those
wonders
before
Pharaoh, which I have
put in thine
hand: but I will
harden his
heart, that he shall not let the
people
go.
\VS{22}And thou shalt
say unto
Pharaoh, Thus
saith the
{\ND{
LORD}},
Israel
{\ADD{is}} my
son,
{\ADD{even}} my
firstborn:
\VS{23}And I
say unto thee, Let my
son
go, that he may
serve me: and if thou
refuse to let him
go, behold, I will
slay thy
son,
{\ADD{even}} thy
firstborn.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}¶ And it came to pass by the
way in the
inn, that the
{\ND{
LORD}}
met him, and
sought to
kill him.
\VS{25}Then
Zipporah
took a sharp
stone, and cut
off the
foreskin of her
son, and
cast
{\ADD{it}} at his
feet, and
said, Surely a
bloody
husband
{\ADD{art}} thou to me.\FTNT{††}{{\FR 4.25 }
sharp…: or, knife}\FTNT{‡‡}{{\FR 4.25 }
cast…: Heb. made it touch}
\VS{26}So he let him
go: then she
said, A
bloody
husband
{\ADD{thou art}}, because of the
circumcision.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}¶ And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
said to
Aaron,
Go into the
wilderness to
meet
Moses. And he
went, and
met him in the
mount of
God, and
kissed him.
\VS{28}And
Moses
told
Aaron all the
words of the
{\ND{
LORD}} who had
sent him, and all the
signs which he had
commanded him.
\par }{\PP \VS{29}¶ And
Moses and
Aaron
went and gathered
together all the
elders of the
children of
Israel:
\VS{30}And
Aaron
spake all the
words which the
{\ND{
LORD}} had
spoken unto
Moses, and
did the
signs in the
sight of the
people.
\VS{31}And the
people
believed: and when they
heard that the
{\ND{
LORD}} had
visited the
children of
Israel, and that he had
looked upon their
affliction, then they bowed their
heads and
worshipped.

\par }\Chap{5}{\PP \VerseOne{1}And
afterward
Moses and
Aaron went
in, and
told
Pharaoh, Thus
saith the
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of
Israel, Let my
people
go, that they may hold a
feast unto me in the
wilderness.
\VS{2}And
Pharaoh
said, Who
{\ADD{is}} the
{\ND{
LORD}}, that I should
obey his
voice to let
Israel
go? I
know not the
{\ND{
LORD}}, neither will I let
Israel
go.
\par }{\PP \VS{3}And they
said, The
God of the
Hebrews hath
met with us: let us
go, we pray thee,
three
days’
journey into the
desert, and
sacrifice unto the
{\ND{
LORD}} our
God; lest he
fall upon us with
pestilence, or with the
sword.
\VS{4}And the
king of
Egypt
said unto them, Wherefore do ye,
Moses and
Aaron,
let the
people from their
works?
get you unto your
burdens.
\VS{5}And
Pharaoh
said, Behold, the
people of the
land now
{\ADD{are}}
many, and ye make them
rest from their
burdens.
\VS{6}And
Pharaoh
commanded the same
day the
taskmasters of the
people, and their
officers,
saying,
\VS{7}Ye shall no
more
give the
people
straw to
make
brick, as
heretofore: let them
go and
gather
straw for themselves.
\VS{8}And the
tale of the
bricks, which they did
make
heretofore, ye shall
lay upon them; ye shall not
diminish
{\ADD{ought}} thereof: for they
{\ADD{be}}
idle; therefore they
cry,
saying, Let us
go
{\ADD{and}}
sacrifice to our
God.
\VS{9}Let there more
work be
laid upon the
men, that they may
labour therein; and let them not
regard
vain
words.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 5.9 }
Let there…: Heb. Let the work be heavy upon the men}
\par }{\PP \VS{10}¶ And the
taskmasters of the
people went
out, and their
officers, and they
spake to the
people,
saying, Thus
saith
Pharaoh, I will not
give you
straw.
\VS{11}Go ye,
get you
straw
where ye can
find it:
yet not
ought of your
work shall be
diminished.
\VS{12}So the
people were scattered
abroad throughout all the
land of
Egypt to
gather
stubble instead of
straw.
\VS{13}And the
taskmasters
hasted
{\ADD{them}},
saying,
Fulfil your
works,

daily
tasks, as when there
was
straw.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 5.13 }
your daily…: Heb. a matter of a day in his day}
\VS{14}And the
officers of the
children of
Israel, which
Pharaoh’s
taskmasters had
set over them, were
beaten,
{\ADD{and}}
demanded, Wherefore have ye not
fulfilled your
task in making
brick both
yesterday and to
day, as

\VS{17}As yet
exaltest thou thyself against my

\VS{18}Behold, to
morrow about this

rain a
very
grievous
hail, such as hath not
been in

since the

\VS{19}Send therefore now,
{\ADD{and}}
gather thy

field;
{\ADD{for upon}} every

found in the

down upon them, and they shall
die.
\VS{20}He that
feared the

Pharaoh made his

flee into the

\VS{21}And he that

forth thine

hail in all the

\VS{23}And
Moses stretched
forth his
rod toward
heaven: and the
{\ND{

sent
thunder and
hail, and the
fire ran
along upon the
ground; and the
{\ND{
LORD}}
rained
hail upon the
land of
Egypt.
\VS{24}So there was
hail, and
fire
mingled with the
hail,
very
grievous, such as there was
none like it in all the
land of
Egypt since it became a
nation.
\VS{25}And the
hail
smote throughout all the
land of
Egypt all that
{\ADD{was}} in the
field, both
man and
beast; and the
hail
smote every
herb of the
field, and
brake every
tree of the
field.
\VS{26}Only in the
land of
Goshen, where the
children of
Israel
{\ADD{were}}, was there no
hail.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}¶ And
Pharaoh
sent, and
called for
Moses and

said unto them, I have
sinned this

righteous, and I and my

{\ADD{are}}
wicked.
\VS{28}Intreat the

\VS{30}But as for thee and thy

know that ye will not yet
fear the

\VS{31}And the
flax and the
barley was
smitten: for the
barley
{\ADD{was}} in the

flax
{\ADD{was}}
bolled.
\VS{32}But the
wheat and the

smitten: for
they
{\ADD{were}} not grown
up.\FTNT{§}{{\FR 9.32 }

\VS{33}And
Moses went
out of the
city from
Pharaoh, and spread
abroad his

thunders and
hail
ceased, and the
rain was not
poured upon the
earth.
\VS{34}And when
Pharaoh
saw that the
rain and the
hail and the
thunders were
ceased, he
sinned yet
more, and
hardened his
heart, he and his
servants.
\VS{35}And the
heart of
Pharaoh was
hardened, neither would he let the
children of

spoken
by
Moses.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 9.35 }

said unto

Go in unto

before him:
\VS{2}And that thou mayest
tell in the

wrought in
Egypt, and my
signs which I have
done among them; that ye may
know how that I

\VS{3}And
Moses and

in unto
Pharaoh, and
said unto him, Thus

refuse to

serve me.
\VS{4}Else, if thou
refuse to let my

bring the
locusts into thy

cover the

able to
see the

escaped, which

fathers have
seen, since the
day that they were upon the
earth unto this
day. And he
turned himself, and went
out from
Pharaoh.
\VS{7}And
Pharaoh’s
servants
said unto him, How long shall this man be a
snare unto us? let the
men
go, that they may
serve the
{\ND{

God:
knowest thou not
yet that
Egypt is
destroyed?
\VS{8}And
Moses and
Aaron were brought
again unto
Pharaoh: and he
said unto them,
Go,

{\ADD{are}} they that shall

\VS{9}And

said, We will

go; for we
{\ADD{must hold}} a
feast unto the

\VS{10}And he
said unto them, Let the

go, and your little

\VS{11}Not so:

eat every

\VS{13}And
Moses stretched
forth his

brought an

morning, the
east
wind
brought the
locusts.
\VS{14}And the
locusts went
up over all the
land of
Egypt, and
rested in all the
coasts of
Egypt:
very
grievous
{\ADD{were they;}}
before them there were no
such
locusts as they, neither
after them shall be such.
\VS{15}For they
covered the
face of the whole
earth, so that the
land was
darkened; and they did
eat every
herb of the
land, and all the
fruit of the
trees which the
hail had
left: and there
remained not any green
thing in the
trees, or in the
herbs of the
field, through all the

called for

harden

follow

know that I

did so.
\par }{\PP \VS{5}¶ And it was
told the

turned against the

said, Why have we
done this, that we have let

serving us?
\VS{6}And he made
ready his

took

hardened the

pursued
after the

out with an
high

\VS{9}But the
Egyptians
pursued
after them, all the
horses

Pharaoh, and his
horsemen, and his
army, and
overtook them
encamping by the

Pi-hahiroth,
before
Baal-zephon.
\par }{\PP \VS{10}¶ And when
Pharaoh drew
nigh, the
children of
Israel lifted
up their

Egyptians
marched
after them; and they were
sore
afraid: and the
children of
Israel cried
out unto the

\VS{11}And they
said unto
Moses, Because

said unto the

angel of
God, which
went
before the

removed and
went
behind them; and the
pillar of the

went from before their

stood
behind them:
\VS{20}And it
came between the
camp of the
Egyptians and the
camp of
Israel; and it was a
cloud and
darkness

light by
night

watch the

looked unto the

Egyptians through the
pillar of
fire and of the
cloud, and
troubled the
host of the
Egyptians,
\VS{25}And took
off their
chariot
wheels, that they
drave them
heavily: so that the

said, Let us
flee from the

said unto

out thine

again upon the

chariots, and upon their
horsemen.
\VS{27}And
Moses stretched
forth his
hand over the
sea, and the
sea
returned to his
strength when the
morning
appeared; and the

fled
against it; and the

overthrew the
Egyptians in the
midst of the

overthrew: Heb. shook off}

returned, and
covered the

Pharaoh that
came into the
sea
after them; there
remained not so much
as
one of them.
\VS{29}But the
children of
Israel
walked upon
dry
{\ADD{land}} in the
midst of the
sea; and the
waters
{\ADD{were}} a
wall unto them on their right

left.
\VS{30}Thus the

saved
Israel that
day out of the
hand of the

Israel
saw the
Egyptians
dead upon the
sea
shore.
\VS{31}And
Israel
saw that
great
work which the

did upon the
Egyptians: and the

feared the

up till the

Moses
bade: and it did not
stink, neither was there any

Moses
said,
Eat that to

day ye shall not
find it in the

\VS{26}Six

gather it; but on the

{\ADD{that}} there went
out
{\ADD{some}} of the

found none.

said unto

refuse ye to

given you the

giveth you on the

day the
bread of two

abide ye every
man in his place, let no

out of his

\VS{30}So the
people
rested on the
seventh
day.
\VS{31}And the
house of
Israel
called the
name thereof
Manna: and it
{\ADD{was}} like
coriander
seed,
white; and the
taste of it
{\ADD{was}} like
wafers
{\ADD{made}} with
honey.

Moses
said, This

commandeth,
Fill an

see the
bread wherewith I have
fed you in the

forth from the

Egypt.
\VS{33}And
Moses
said unto
Aaron,
Take
a

put an

full of
manna therein, and lay it
up
before the

\VS{34}As the

commanded

Aaron laid it
up
before the

kept.

eat
manna
forty

came to a

Rephidim: and
{\ADD{there was}} no
water for the

\VS{2}Wherefore the

chide with
Moses, and
said,
Give us

Moses
said unto them, Why
chide ye with me? wherefore do ye
tempt the

thirsted there for

murmured against
Moses, and
said, Wherefore

{\ADD{that}} thou hast
brought us up out of
Egypt, to
kill us and our
children and our

thirst?
\VS{4}And
Moses
cried unto the

saying, What shall I
do unto this

almost ready to
stone me.

said unto
Moses, Go

go.
\VS{6}Behold, I will
stand
before thee there upon the

Horeb; and thou shalt
smite the

come

Moses
did so in the
sight of the
elders of
Israel.
\VS{7}And he
called the
name of the

Massah, and
Meribah, because of the

off the
golden

{\ADD{were}} in their

brought
{\ADD{them}} unto
Aaron.
\VS{4}And he
received
{\ADD{them}} at their
hand, and
fashioned it with a graving
tool, after he had
made it a
molten
calf: and they
said, These
{\ADD{be}} thy
gods, O
Israel, which
brought thee up out of the
land of
Egypt.
\VS{5}And when
Aaron
saw
{\ADD{it}}, he
built an
altar
before it; and
Aaron made
proclamation, and
said, To
morrow
{\ADD{is}} a
feast to the
{\ND{

\VS{6}And they rose up
early on the
morrow, and
offered burnt

brought peace
offerings; and the

sat down to
eat and to

up to
play.

Go, get thee
down; for thy

corrupted
{\ADD{themselves:}}
\VS{8}They have
turned aside
quickly out of the
way which I
commanded them: they have
made them a
molten

worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and
said, These
{\ADD{be}} thy

up out of the

said unto

stiffnecked
people:
\VS{10}Now therefore let me
alone, that my
wrath may wax
hot against them, and that I may
consume them: and I will
make of thee a
great
nation.
\VS{11}And
Moses
besought the
{\ND{
LORD}} his
God, and
said,
{\ND{

wrath wax
hot against thy
people, which thou hast brought
forth out of the

power, and with a
mighty
hand?\FTNT{*}{{\FR 32.11 }

speak, and

bring them out, to
slay them in the
mountains, and to
consume them from the
face of the
earth?
Turn from thy
fierce
wrath, and
repent of this
evil against thy
people.
\VS{13}Remember
Abraham,
Isaac, and
Israel, thy
servants, to whom thou
swarest by thine own self, and
saidst unto them, I will
multiply your
seed as the
stars of
heaven, and all this
land that I have
spoken of will I
give unto your
seed, and they shall
inherit
{\ADD{it}} for
ever.
\VS{14}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
repented of the
evil which he
thought to
do unto his
people.
\par }{\PP \VS{15}¶ And
Moses
turned, and went
down from the
mount, and the
two
tables of the
testimony
{\ADD{were}} in his
hand: the
tables
{\ADD{were}}
written on
both their
sides; on the one side and on the other
{\ADD{were}} they
written.
\VS{16}And the
tables
{\ADD{were}} the
work of
God, and the
writing
{\ADD{was}} the
writing of
God,
graven upon the
tables.
\VS{17}And when
Joshua
heard the
noise of the
people as they
shouted, he
said unto
Moses,
{\ADD{There is}} a
noise of
war in the
camp.
\VS{18}And he
said,
{\ADD{It is}} not the
voice of
{\ADD{them that}}
shout for
mastery, neither
{\ADD{is it}} the

cry for being
overcome:

\par }{\PP \VS{19}¶ And it came to pass, as soon as he came
nigh unto the
camp, that he
saw the
calf, and the
dancing: and
Moses’
anger waxed
hot, and he
cast the
tables out of his
hands, and
brake them
beneath the
mount.
\VS{20}And he
took the
calf which they had
made, and
burnt
{\ADD{it}} in the
fire, and
ground
{\ADD{it}} to
powder, and
strawed
{\ADD{it}}
upon the
water, and made the
children of
Israel
drink
{\ADD{of it}}.
\par }{\PP \VS{21}And
Moses
said unto
Aaron, What
did this
people unto thee, that thou hast
brought so
great a
sin upon them?
\VS{22}And
Aaron
said, Let not the
anger of my
lord wax
hot: thou
knowest the
people, that they
{\ADD{are set}} on
mischief.
\VS{23}For they
said unto me,
Make us
gods, which shall
go
before us: for
{\ADD{as for}} this
Moses, the
man that brought us
up out of the
land of
Egypt, we
wot not what is become of him.
\VS{24}And I
said unto them, Whosoever hath any
gold, let them
break
{\ADD{it}} off. So they
gave
{\ADD{it}} me: then I
cast it into the
fire, and there came
out this
calf.
\par }{\PP \VS{25}¶ And when
Moses
saw that the
people
{\ADD{were}}
naked; (for
Aaron had made them
naked unto
{\ADD{their}}
shame among their
enemies:)\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 32.25 }
their enemies: Heb. those that rose up against them}
\VS{26}Then
Moses
stood in the
gate of the
camp, and
said, Who
{\ADD{is}} on the
{\ND{
LORD’s}} side?
{\ADD{let him come}} unto me. And all the
sons of
Levi
gathered themselves together unto him.
\VS{27}And he
said unto them, Thus
saith the
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of
Israel,
Put every
man his
sword by his
side,
{\ADD{and}}
go in and
out from
gate to
gate throughout the
camp, and
slay every

brother, and every
man his
companion, and every
man his
neighbour.
\VS{28}And the
children of
Levi
did according to the
word of
Moses: and there
fell of the
people that
day about
three
thousand
men.
\VS{29}For
Moses had
said, Consecrate
yourselves to

brother; that he may
bestow upon you a
blessing this

morrow, that
Moses
said unto the
people, Ye have
sinned a
great
sin: and now I will go
up unto the
{\ND{
LORD}};
peradventure I shall make an
atonement
for your
sin.
\VS{31}And
Moses
returned unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}, and
said,
Oh, this
people have
sinned a
great
sin, and have
made them
gods of
gold.
\VS{32}Yet now, if thou wilt
forgive their
sin—; and if not,
blot me, I pray thee, out of thy
book which thou hast
written.
\VS{33}And the
{\ND{

said unto
Moses,
Whosoever hath
sinned against me, him will I blot
out of my
book.
\VS{34}Therefore now
go,
lead the
people unto
{\ADD{the place}} of which I have
spoken unto thee: behold, mine
Angel shall
go
before thee: nevertheless in the
day when I
visit I will
visit their

\VS{35}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
plagued the
people,
because they
made the

which
Aaron
made.

\par }\Chap{33}{\PP \VerseOne{1}And the

Depart,

sware unto
Abraham, to

flowing with

consume thee in the

\par }{\PP \VS{4}¶ And when the
people
heard these
evil

mourned: and no

put on him his

\VS{5}For the

said unto
Moses,
Say unto the

up into the

consume thee: therefore now put
off thy

know what to

\VS{6}And the
children of
Israel
stripped themselves of their
ornaments by the
mount
Horeb.
\par }{\PP \VS{7}And
Moses
took the
tabernacle, and
pitched it
without the
camp, afar
off from the
camp, and
called it the
Tabernacle of the
congregation. And it came to pass,
{\ADD{that}} every one which
sought the
{\ND{
LORD}} went
out unto the
tabernacle of the
congregation, which
{\ADD{was}}
without the
camp.
\VS{8}And it came to pass, when
Moses went
out unto the
tabernacle,
{\ADD{that}} all the
people rose
up, and
stood every
man
{\ADD{at}} his
tent
door, and
looked
after
Moses, until he was
gone into the
tabernacle.
\VS{9}And it came to pass, as
Moses
entered into the
tabernacle, the
cloudy
pillar
descended, and
stood
{\ADD{at}} the
door of the
tabernacle, and
{\ADD{the
{\ND{LORD}}}}
talked with
Moses.

saw the

pillar
stand
{\ADD{at}} the

up and
worshipped, every

{\ADD{in}} his

\VS{11}And the
{\ND{

spake unto
Moses
face to

speaketh unto his

again into the
camp: but his
servant
Joshua, the
son of
Nun, a young
man,
departed not
out of the
tabernacle.

Moses
said unto the
{\ND{

See, thou
sayest unto me, Bring
up this
people: and thou hast not let me
know whom thou wilt
send with me. Yet thou hast
said, I
know thee by

found
grace in my

found
grace in thy

shew me now thy

know thee, that I may
find

{\ADD{is}} thy

said, My

go
{\ADD{with thee}}, and I will give thee
rest.
\VS{15}And he
said unto him, If thy

go not
{\ADD{with me}}, carry us not
up hence.
\VS{16}For wherein shall it be
known
here that I and thy

found
grace in thy

separated, I and thy

said unto

do this

spoken: for thou hast
found
grace in my

know thee by

said, I beseech
thee,

children of
Israel.
\VS{7}And he
put them on the
shoulders of the
ephod,
{\ADD{that they should be}}
stones for a
memorial to the
children of
Israel; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{8}¶ And he
made the
breastplate
{\ADD{of}}
cunning
work, like the
work of the
ephod;
{\ADD{of}}
gold,
blue, and
purple, and
scarlet, and fine
twined
linen.
\VS{9}It was
foursquare; they
made the
breastplate
double: a
span
{\ADD{was}} the
length thereof, and a
span the
breadth thereof,
{\ADD{being}}
doubled.
\VS{10}And they
set in it
four
rows of
stones:
{\ADD{the first}}
row
{\ADD{was}} a
sardius, a
topaz, and a
carbuncle: this
{\ADD{was}} the
first
row.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 39.10 }
sardius: or, ruby}
\VS{11}And the
second
row, an
emerald, a
sapphire, and a
diamond.
\VS{12}And the
third
row, a
ligure, an
agate, and an
amethyst.
\VS{13}And the
fourth
row, a
beryl, an
onyx, and a
jasper:
{\ADD{they were}}
inclosed in
ouches of
gold in their
inclosings.
\VS{14}And the
stones
{\ADD{were}} according to the
names of the
children of
Israel,
twelve, according to their
names,
{\ADD{like}} the
engravings of a
signet, every
one with his
name, according to the
twelve
tribes.
\VS{15}And they
made upon the
breastplate
chains at the
ends,
{\ADD{of}}
wreathen
work
{\ADD{of}}
pure
gold.
\VS{16}And they
made
two
ouches
{\ADD{of}}
gold, and
two
gold
rings; and
put the
two
rings in the
two
ends of the
breastplate.
\VS{17}And they
put the
two wreathen
chains of
gold in the
two
rings on the
ends of the
breastplate.
\VS{18}And the
two
ends of the
two
wreathen
chains they
fastened in the
two
ouches, and
put them on the
shoulderpieces of the
ephod,
before
it.
\VS{19}And they
made
two
rings of
gold, and
put
{\ADD{them}} on the
two
ends of the
breastplate, upon the
border of it, which
{\ADD{was}} on the
side of the
ephod
inward.
\VS{20}And they
made
two
{\ADD{other}}
golden
rings, and
put them on the
two
sides of the
ephod
underneath,
toward the
forepart of it, over
against the
{\ADD{other}}
coupling thereof,
above the curious
girdle of the
ephod.
\VS{21}And they did
bind the
breastplate by his
rings unto the
rings of the
ephod with a
lace of
blue, that it might be above the curious
girdle of the
ephod, and that the
breastplate might not be
loosed from the
ephod; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}¶ And he
made the
robe of the
ephod
{\ADD{of}}
woven
work,
all
{\ADD{of}}
blue.
\VS{23}And
{\ADD{there was}} an
hole in the
midst of the
robe, as the
hole of an
habergeon,
{\ADD{with}} a
band round
about the
hole, that it should not
rend.
\VS{24}And they
made upon the
hems of the
robe
pomegranates
{\ADD{of}}
blue, and
purple, and
scarlet,
{\ADD{and}}
twined
{\ADD{linen}}.
\VS{25}And they
made
bells
{\ADD{of}}
pure
gold, and
put the
bells
between the
pomegranates upon the
hem of the
robe, round
about
between the
pomegranates;
\VS{26}A
bell and a
pomegranate, a
bell and a
pomegranate, round
about the
hem of the
robe to
minister
{\ADD{in;}} as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{27}¶ And they
made
coats
{\ADD{of}} fine
linen
{\ADD{of}}
woven
work for
Aaron, and for his
sons,
\VS{28}And a
mitre
{\ADD{of}} fine
linen, and
goodly
bonnets
{\ADD{of}} fine
linen, and
linen
breeches
{\ADD{of}} fine
twined
linen,
\VS{29}And a
girdle
{\ADD{of}} fine
twined
linen, and
blue, and
purple, and
scarlet,
{\ADD{of}}
needlework; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{30}¶ And they
made the
plate of the
holy
crown
{\ADD{of}}
pure
gold, and
wrote upon it a
writing,
{\ADD{like to}} the
engravings of a
signet,
HOLINESS TO THE
{\ND{
LORD}}.
\VS{31}And they
tied unto it a
lace of
blue, to
fasten
{\ADD{it}} on
high upon the
mitre; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{32}¶ Thus was all the
work of the
tabernacle of the
tent of the
congregation
finished: and the
children of
Israel
did according to all that the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses, so
did they.
\par }{\PP \VS{33}¶ And they
brought the
tabernacle unto
Moses, the
tent, and all his
furniture, his
taches, his
boards, his
bars, and his
pillars, and his
sockets,
\VS{34}And the
covering of
rams’
skins dyed
red, and the
covering of
badgers’
skins, and the
vail of the
covering,
\VS{35}The
ark of the
testimony, and the
staves thereof, and the mercy
seat,
\VS{36}The
table,
{\ADD{and}} all the
vessels thereof, and the
shewbread,
\VS{37}The
pure
candlestick,
{\ADD{with}} the
lamps thereof,
{\ADD{even with}} the
lamps to be set in
order, and all the
vessels thereof, and the
oil for
light,
\VS{38}And the
golden
altar, and the
anointing
oil, and the
sweet
incense, and the
hanging for the
tabernacle
door,\FTNT{†}{{\FR 39.38 }
the sweet…: Heb. the incense of sweet spices}
\VS{39}The
brasen
altar, and his
grate of
brass, his
staves, and all his
vessels, the
laver and his
foot,
\VS{40}The
hangings of the
court, his
pillars, and his
sockets, and the
hanging for the
court
gate, his
cords, and his
pins, and all the
vessels of the
service of the
tabernacle, for the
tent of the
congregation,
\VS{41}The
cloths of
service to do
service in the
holy
{\ADD{place}}, and the
holy
garments for
Aaron the
priest, and his
sons’
garments, to minister in the
priest’s office.
\VS{42}According to all that the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses, so the
children of
Israel
made all the
work.
\VS{43}And
Moses did
look upon
all the
work, and, behold, they had
done it as the
{\ND{
LORD}} had
commanded, even so had they
done it: and
Moses
blessed them.

\par }\Chap{40}{\PP \VerseOne{1}And the
{\ND{
LORD}}
spake unto
Moses,
saying,
\VS{2}On the
first
day of the
first
month shalt thou set
up the
tabernacle of the
tent of the
congregation.
\VS{3}And thou shalt
put
therein the
ark of the
testimony, and
cover the
ark with the
vail.
\VS{4}And thou shalt
bring in the
table, and set in
order the things that are to be set in
order upon it; and thou shalt
bring in the
candlestick, and
light the
lamps thereof.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 40.4 }
the things…: Heb. the order thereof}
\VS{5}And thou shalt
set the
altar of
gold for the
incense
before the
ark of the
testimony, and
put the
hanging of the
door to the
tabernacle.
\VS{6}And thou shalt
set the
altar of the burnt
offering
before the
door of the
tabernacle of the
tent of the
congregation.
\VS{7}And thou shalt
set the
laver between the
tent of the
congregation and the
altar, and shalt
put
water therein.
\VS{8}And thou shalt set
up the
court round
about, and hang
up the
hanging at the
court
gate.
\VS{9}And thou shalt
take the
anointing
oil, and
anoint the
tabernacle, and all that
{\ADD{is}} therein, and shalt
hallow it, and all the
vessels thereof: and it shall be
holy.
\VS{10}And thou shalt
anoint the
altar of the burnt
offering, and all his
vessels, and
sanctify the
altar: and it shall be an
altar
most
holy.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 40.10 }
most holy: Heb. holiness of holinesses}
\VS{11}And thou shalt
anoint the
laver and his
foot, and
sanctify it.
\VS{12}And thou shalt
bring
Aaron and his
sons unto the
door of the
tabernacle of the
congregation, and
wash them with
water.
\VS{13}And thou shalt
put upon
Aaron the
holy
garments, and
anoint him, and
sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
priest’s office.
\VS{14}And thou shalt
bring his
sons, and
clothe them with
coats:
\VS{15}And thou shalt
anoint them, as thou didst
anoint their
father, that they may minister unto me in the
priest’s office: for their
anointing shall surely be an
everlasting
priesthood throughout their
generations.
\par }{\PP \VS{16}Thus
did
Moses: according to all that the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded him, so
did he.
\par }{\PP \VS{17}¶ And it came to pass in the
first
month in the
second
year, on the
first
{\ADD{day}} of the
month,
{\ADD{that}} the
tabernacle was reared
up.
\VS{18}And
Moses reared
up the
tabernacle, and
fastened his
sockets, and set
up the
boards thereof, and
put in the
bars thereof, and reared
up his
pillars.
\VS{19}And he spread
abroad the
tent over the
tabernacle, and
put the
covering of the
tent
above upon it; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{20}¶ And he
took and
put the
testimony into the
ark, and
set the
staves on the
ark, and
put the mercy
seat
above upon the
ark:
\VS{21}And he
brought the
ark into the
tabernacle, and set
up the
vail of the
covering, and
covered the
ark of the
testimony; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{22}¶ And he
put the
table in the
tent of the
congregation, upon the
side of the
tabernacle
northward,
without the
vail.
\VS{23}And he
set the
bread in
order upon it
before the
{\ND{
LORD}}; as the
{\ND{
LORD}} had
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}¶ And he
put the
candlestick in the
tent of the
congregation, over
against the
table, on the
side of the
tabernacle
southward.
\VS{25}And he
lighted the
lamps
before the
{\ND{
LORD}}; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{26}¶ And he
put the
golden
altar in the
tent of the
congregation
before the
vail:
\VS{27}And he
burnt
sweet
incense thereon; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{28}¶ And he set
up the
hanging
{\ADD{at}} the
door of the
tabernacle.
\VS{29}And he
put the
altar of burnt
offering
{\ADD{by}} the
door of the
tabernacle of the
tent of the
congregation, and
offered upon it the burnt
offering and the meat
offering; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\par }{\PP \VS{30}¶ And he
set the
laver between the
tent of the
congregation and the
altar, and
put
water there, to
wash
{\ADD{withal}}.
\VS{31}And
Moses and
Aaron and his
sons
washed their
hands and their
feet thereat:
\VS{32}When they
went into the
tent of the
congregation, and when they came
near unto the
altar, they
washed; as the
{\ND{
LORD}}
commanded
Moses.
\VS{33}And he reared
up the
court round
about the
tabernacle and the
altar, and set
up the
hanging of the
court
gate. So
Moses
finished the
work.
\par }{\PP \VS{34}¶ Then a
cloud
covered the
tent of the
congregation, and the
glory of the
{\ND{
LORD}}
filled the
tabernacle.
\VS{35}And
Moses was not
able to
enter into the
tent of the
congregation, because the
cloud
abode thereon, and the
glory of the
{\ND{
LORD}}
filled the
tabernacle.
\VS{36}And when the
cloud was taken
up
from over the
tabernacle, the
children of
Israel went
onward in all their
journeys:\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 40.36 }
went onward: Heb. journeyed}
\VS{37}But if the
cloud were not taken
up, then they
journeyed not till the
day that it was taken
up.
\VS{38}For the
cloud of the
{\ND{
LORD}}
{\ADD{was}} upon the
tabernacle by
day, and
fire was on it by
night, in the
sight of all the
house of
Israel, throughout all their
journeys.
