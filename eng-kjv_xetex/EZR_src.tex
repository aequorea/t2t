up the

saying,\FTNT{*}{{\FR 1.1 }

God of

build the

God of

Jeshua the
son of

out of the

Jerusalem; and
appointed the

set the
priests in their

trumpets, and the
Levites the
sons of
Asaph with
cymbals, to
praise the
{\ND{
LORD}}, after the
ordinance of
David
king of
Israel.
\VS{11}And they sang together by
course in
praising and giving
thanks unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}; because
{\ADD{he is}}
good, for his
mercy
{\ADD{endureth}} for
ever toward
Israel. And all the
people
shouted with a
great
shout, when they
praised the
{\ND{
LORD}}, because the
foundation of the
house of the
{\ND{
LORD}} was
laid.
\VS{12}But
many of the
priests and
Levites and
chief of the
fathers,
{\ADD{who were}} ancient
men, that had
seen the
first
house, when the
foundation of this
house was
laid before their
eyes,
wept with a
loud
voice; and
many
shouted
aloud for

discern the
noise of the

shouted with a

together will
build unto the

God of
Israel, as
king
Cyrus the

commanded us.
\VS{4}Then the

them into the

took out

enemy in the
way: because we had
spoken unto the
king,
saying, The
hand of our
God
{\ADD{is}} upon all them for
good that
seek him; but his
power and his
wrath
{\ADD{is}} against all them that
forsake him.
\VS{23}So we
fasted and
besought our
God for this: and he was
intreated of us.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}¶ Then I
separated
twelve of the
chief of the
priests,
Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and
ten of their
brethren with them,
\VS{25}And
weighed unto them the
silver, and the
gold, and the
vessels,
{\ADD{even}} the
offering of the
house of our
God, which the
king, and his
counsellors, and his
lords, and all
Israel
{\ADD{there}}
present, had
offered:
\VS{26}I even
weighed unto their
hand
six
hundred and
fifty
talents of
silver, and
silver
vessels an
hundred
talents,
{\ADD{and}} of
gold an
hundred
talents;
\VS{27}Also
twenty
basons of
gold, of a
thousand
drams; and
two
vessels of
fine
copper,
precious as
gold.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 8.27 }
fine…: Heb. yellow, or, shining brass}\FTNT{††}{{\FR 8.27 }
precious: Heb. desirable}
\VS{28}And I
said unto them, Ye
{\ADD{are}}
holy unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}; the
vessels
{\ADD{are}}
holy also; and the
silver and the
gold
{\ADD{are}} a freewill
offering unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of your
fathers.
\VS{29}Watch ye, and
keep
{\ADD{them}}, until ye
weigh
{\ADD{them}}
before the
chief of the
priests and the
Levites, and
chief of the
fathers of
Israel, at
Jerusalem, in the
chambers of the
house of the
{\ND{
LORD}}.
\VS{30}So
took the
priests and the
Levites the
weight of the
silver, and the
gold, and the
vessels, to
bring
{\ADD{them}} to
Jerusalem unto the
house of our
God.
\par }{\PP \VS{31}¶ Then we
departed from the
river of
Ahava on the
twelfth
{\ADD{day}} of the
first
month, to
go unto
Jerusalem: and the
hand of our
God was upon us, and he
delivered us from the
hand of the
enemy, and of such as lay in
wait by the
way.
\VS{32}And we
came to
Jerusalem, and
abode there
three
days.
\par }{\PP \VS{33}¶ Now on the
fourth
day was the
silver and the
gold and the
vessels
weighed in the
house of our
God by the
hand of
Meremoth the
son of
Uriah the
priest; and with him
{\ADD{was}}
Eleazar the
son of
Phinehas; and with them
{\ADD{was}}
Jozabad the
son of
Jeshua, and
Noadiah the
son of
Binnui,
Levites;
\VS{34}By
number
{\ADD{and}} by
weight of every one: and all the
weight was
written at that
time.
\VS{35}{\ADD{Also}} the
children of those that had been carried
away, which were come
out of the
captivity,
offered burnt
offerings unto the
God of
Israel,
twelve
bullocks for all
Israel,
ninety and
six
rams,
seventy and
seven
lambs,
twelve he
goats
{\ADD{for}} a sin
offering: all
{\ADD{this was}} a burnt
offering unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}.
\par }{\PP \VS{36}¶ And they
delivered the
king’s
commissions unto the
king’s
lieutenants, and to the
governors on this
side the
river: and they
furthered the
people, and the
house of
God.

\par }\Chap{9}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now when these things were
done, the
princes
came to me,
saying, The
people of
Israel, and the
priests, and the
Levites, have not
separated themselves from the
people of the
lands,
{\ADD{doing}} according to their
abominations,
{\ADD{even}} of the
Canaanites, the
Hittites, the
Perizzites, the
Jebusites, the
Ammonites, the
Moabites, the
Egyptians, and the
Amorites.
\VS{2}For they have
taken of their
daughters for themselves, and for their
sons: so that the
holy
seed have
mingled themselves with the
people of
{\ADD{those}}
lands: yea, the
hand of the
princes and
rulers hath been
chief in this
trespass.
\VS{3}And when I
heard this
thing, I
rent my
garment and my
mantle, and plucked
off the
hair of my
head and of my
beard, and sat
down
astonied.
\VS{4}Then were
assembled unto me every one that
trembled at the
words of the
God of
Israel, because of the
transgression of those that had been carried
away; and I
sat
astonied until the
evening
sacrifice.
\par }{\PP \VS{5}¶ And at the
evening
sacrifice I arose
up from my
heaviness; and having
rent my
garment and my
mantle, I
fell upon my
knees, and spread
out my
hands unto the
{\ND{
LORD}} my
God,\FTNT{*}{{\FR 9.5 }
heaviness: or, affliction}
\VS{6}And
said, O my
God, I am
ashamed and
blush to lift
up my
face to thee, my
God: for our
iniquities are
increased
over
{\ADD{our}}
head, and our
trespass is grown
up unto the
heavens.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 9.6 }
trespass: or, guiltiness}
\VS{7}Since the
days of our
fathers
{\ADD{have}} we
{\ADD{been}} in a
great
trespass unto this
day; and for our
iniquities have we, our
kings,
{\ADD{and}} our
priests, been
delivered into the
hand of the
kings of the
lands, to the
sword, to
captivity, and to a
spoil, and to
confusion of
face, as
{\ADD{it is}} this
day.
\VS{8}And now for a
little
space
grace hath been
{\ADD{shewed}} from the
{\ND{
LORD}} our
God, to
leave us a remnant to
escape, and to
give us a
nail in his
holy
place, that our
God may
lighten our
eyes, and
give us a
little
reviving in our
bondage.\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 9.8 }
space: Heb. moment}\FTNT{§}{{\FR 9.8 }
a nail: or, a pin: that is, a constant and sure abode}
\VS{9}For we
{\ADD{were}}
bondmen; yet our
God hath not
forsaken us in our
bondage, but hath
extended
mercy unto us in the
sight of the
kings of
Persia, to
give us a
reviving, to set
up the
house of our
God, and to
repair the
desolations thereof, and to
give us a
wall in
Judah and in
Jerusalem.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 9.9 }
to repair: Heb. to set up}
\VS{10}And now, O our
God, what shall we
say
after this? for we have
forsaken thy
commandments,
\VS{11}Which thou hast
commanded
by thy
servants the
prophets,
saying, The
land, unto which ye
go to
possess it, is an
unclean
land with the
filthiness of the
people of the
lands, with their
abominations, which have
filled it from one
end to
another with their
uncleanness.\FTNT{††}{{\FR 9.11 }
by: Heb. by the hand of}\FTNT{‡‡}{{\FR 9.11 }
from…: Heb. from mouth to mouth}
\VS{12}Now therefore
give not your
daughters unto their
sons, neither
take their
daughters unto your
sons, nor
seek their
peace or their
wealth
for
ever: that ye may be
strong, and
eat the
good of the
land, and leave
{\ADD{it}} for an
inheritance to your
children for
ever.
\VS{13}And
after all that is
come upon us for our
evil
deeds, and for our
great
trespass, seeing that thou our
God hast
punished us
less than our
iniquities
{\ADD{deserve}}, and hast
given us
{\ADD{such}}
deliverance as this;\FTNT{§§}{{\FR 9.13 }
hast punished…: Heb. hast withheld beneath our iniquities}
\VS{14}Should we
again
break thy
commandments, and join in
affinity with the
people of these
abominations? wouldest not thou be
angry with us till thou hadst
consumed
{\ADD{us}}, so that
{\ADD{there should be}} no
remnant nor
escaping?
\VS{15}O
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of
Israel, thou
{\ADD{art}}
righteous: for we
remain yet
escaped, as
{\ADD{it is}} this
day: behold, we
{\ADD{are}}
before thee in our
trespasses: for we cannot
stand
before thee because of this.

\par }\Chap{10}{\PP \VerseOne{1}Now when
Ezra had
prayed, and when he had
confessed,
weeping and casting himself
down
before the
house of
God, there
assembled unto him out of
Israel a
very
great
congregation of
men and
women and
children: for the
people
wept
very
sore.\FTNT{*}{{\FR 10.1 }
wept…: Heb. wept a great weeping}
\VS{2}And
Shechaniah the
son of
Jehiel,
{\ADD{one}} of the
sons of
Elam,
answered and
said unto
Ezra, We have
trespassed against our
God, and have
taken
strange
wives of the
people of the
land: yet now there
is
hope in
Israel concerning this thing.
\VS{3}Now therefore let us
make a
covenant with our
God to put
away all the
wives, and such as are
born of them, according to the
counsel of my
lord, and of those that
tremble at the
commandment of our
God; and let it be
done according to the
law.\FTNT{†}{{\FR 10.3 }
to put…: Heb. to bring forth}
\VS{4}Arise; for
{\ADD{this}}
matter
{\ADD{belongeth}} unto thee: we also
{\ADD{will be}} with thee: be of good
courage, and
do
{\ADD{it}}.
\VS{5}Then
arose
Ezra, and made the
chief
priests, the
Levites, and all
Israel, to
swear that they should
do according to this
word. And they
sware.
\par }{\PP \VS{6}¶ Then
Ezra rose
up from
before the
house of
God, and
went into the
chamber of
Johanan the
son of
Eliashib: and
{\ADD{when}} he
came thither, he did
eat no
bread, nor
drink
water: for he
mourned because of the
transgression of them that had been carried
away.
\VS{7}And they made
proclamation throughout
Judah and
Jerusalem unto all the
children of the
captivity, that they should gather themselves
together unto
Jerusalem;
\VS{8}And that whosoever would not
come within
three
days, according to the
counsel of the
princes and the
elders, all his
substance should be
forfeited, and himself
separated from the
congregation of those that had been carried
away.\FTNT{‡}{{\FR 10.8 }
forfeited: Heb. devoted}
\par }{\PP \VS{9}¶ Then all the
men of
Judah and
Benjamin gathered themselves
together unto
Jerusalem within
three
days. It
{\ADD{was}} the
ninth
month, on the
twentieth
{\ADD{day}} of the
month; and all the
people
sat in the
street of the
house of
God,
trembling because of
{\ADD{this}}
matter, and for the great
rain.\FTNT{§}{{\FR 10.9 }
the great…: Heb. the showers}
\VS{10}And
Ezra the
priest stood
up, and
said unto them, Ye have
transgressed, and have
taken
strange
wives, to
increase the
trespass of
Israel.\FTNT{**}{{\FR 10.10 }
have taken: Heb. have caused to dwell, or, have brought back}
\VS{11}Now therefore
make
confession unto the
{\ND{
LORD}}
God of your
fathers, and
do his
pleasure: and
separate yourselves from the
people of the
land, and from the
strange
wives.
\VS{12}Then all the
congregation
answered and
said with a
loud
voice, As thou hast
said, so must we
do.
\VS{13}But the
people
{\ADD{are}}
many, and
{\ADD{it is}} a
time of much
rain, and we are not
able to
stand
without, neither
{\ADD{is this}} a
work of
one
day or
two: for we are
many that have
transgressed in this
thing.\FTNT{††}{{\FR 10.13 }
we are many…: or, we have greatly offended in this thing}
\VS{14}Let now our
rulers of all the
congregation
stand, and let all them which have
taken
strange
wives in our
cities
come at
appointed
times, and with them the
elders of every
city, and the
judges thereof, until the
fierce
wrath of our
God for this
matter be
turned from us.\FTNT{‡‡}{{\FR 10.14 }
for this…: or, till this matter be dispatched}

Jonathan the

so. And
Ezra the

separated, and sat
down in the
first

strange
