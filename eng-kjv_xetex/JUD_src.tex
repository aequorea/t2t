{\MT THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JUDE

\par }\OneChap {\PP \VerseOne{1}Jude, the
servant of
Jesus
Christ,
and
brother of
James, to them that are
sanctified
by
God the
Father,
and
preserved in
Jesus
Christ,
{\ADD{and}}
called:
\VS{2}Mercy unto
you,
and
peace,
and
love, be
multiplied.
\par }{\PP \VS{3}Beloved, when I
gave
all
diligence to
write unto
you
of the
common
salvation, it
was
needful for
me to
write unto
you, and
exhort
{\ADD{you}} that ye should earnestly
contend for the
faith which
was
once
delivered unto the
saints.
\VS{4}For there
are
certain
men crept in
unawares, who
were before of
old
ordained
to
this
condemnation, ungodly
men,
turning the
grace
of
our
God
into
lasciviousness,
and
denying
the
only
Lord
God,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ.
\VS{5}I
will
therefore
put
you in
remembrance,
though
ye
once
knew
this, how
that the
Lord, having
saved the
people out
of the
land of
Egypt,
afterward
destroyed them that
believed
not.
\VS{6}And the
angels which
kept
not
their first
estate,
but
left their
own
habitation, he hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto the
judgment of
the
great
day.
\VS{7}Even
as
Sodom
and
Gomorrha,
and the
cities
about
them
in
like
manner, giving themselves over to
fornication,
and
going
after
strange
flesh, are set
forth for an
example,
suffering the
vengeance
of
eternal
fire.
\VS{8}Likewise
also
these
{\ADD{filthy}}
dreamers
defile the
flesh,
despise
dominion,
and speak
evil of
dignities.
\VS{9}Yet
Michael the
archangel,
when
contending with the
devil he
disputed
about the
body of
Moses,
durst
not bring against
him
a
railing
accusation,
but
said, The
Lord
rebuke
thee.
\VS{10}But
these speak
evil of those things
which they
know
not:
but
what they
know
naturally,
as
brute
beasts,
in those
things they corrupt
themselves.
\VS{11}Woe unto
them!
for they have
gone in the
way of
Cain,
and ran
greedily after the
error of
Balaam for
reward,
and
perished in the
gainsaying of
Core.
\VS{12}These
are
spots
in
your feasts of
charity, when they feast
with
you,
feeding
themselves without
fear:
clouds
{\ADD{they are}} without
water, carried
about
of
winds;
trees whose fruit
withereth, without
fruit,
twice
dead, plucked up by the
roots;
\VS{13}Raging
waves of the
sea, foaming
out their
own
shame;
wandering
stars, to
whom is
reserved the
blackness of
darkness
for
ever.
\VS{14}And
Enoch
also, the
seventh
from
Adam,
prophesied of
these,
saying,
Behold, the
Lord
cometh
with ten
thousands
of
his
saints,
\VS{15}To
execute
judgment
upon
all,
and to
convince
all that are
ungodly among
them
of
all
their
ungodly
deeds
which they have ungodly
committed,
and
of
all their
hard
{\ADD{speeches}}
which
ungodly
sinners have
spoken
against
him.
\VS{16}These
are
murmurers,
complainers,
walking
after their
own
lusts;
and
their
mouth
speaketh great
swelling
{\ADD{words}},
having
men’s persons in
admiration because
of
advantage.
\par }{\PP \VS{17}But,
beloved,
remember
ye the
words which were spoken
before
of the
apostles
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ;
\VS{18}How
that they
told
you there should
be
mockers
in
the
last
time, who should
walk
after their
own
ungodly
lusts.
\VS{19}These
be they who
separate
themselves,
sensual,
having
not the
Spirit.
\VS{20}But
ye,
beloved, building
up
yourselves
on
your most
holy
faith,
praying
in
the
Holy
Ghost,
\VS{21}Keep
yourselves
in the
love of
God, looking
for the
mercy
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
unto
eternal
life.
\VS{22}And of
some have
compassion, making a
difference:
\VS{23}And
others
save
with
fear,
pulling
{\ADD{them}} out
of the
fire;
hating
even the
garment
spotted
by the
flesh.
\par }{\PP \VS{24}Now unto him that is
able to
keep
you from
falling,
and to
present
{\ADD{you}}
faultless before the
presence
of
his
glory
with exceeding
joy,
\VS{25}To
the
only
wise
God
our
Saviour,
{\ADD{be}}
glory
and
majesty,
dominion
and
power,
both
now
and
ever.
Amen.
