leave none of it unto the

man that
{\ADD{is}}
clean, and is not in a

forbeareth to
keep the
passover, even the same
soul shall be cut
off from among his
people: because he
brought not the
offering of the

man shall
bear his
sin.

stranger shall
sojourn among you, and will
keep the

Edom
said unto him, Thou shalt not

said, Thou shalt not go

Edom came
out

sent
fiery

Make thee a fiery

taken all his

\VS{27}Wherefore they that speak in
proverbs
say,
Come into
Heshbon, let the

built and
prepared:
\VS{28}For there is a
fire gone
out of
Heshbon, a

consumed

places of
Arnon.
\VS{29}Woe to thee,
Moab! thou art
undone, O
people of
Chemosh: he hath

\VS{30}We have
shot at them;
Heshbon is
perished even unto

departed with the rewards of

standing in the

smote the

went

stood in a

opened the

said unto

done unto thee, that thou hast
smitten me these

\VS{29}And
Balaam
said unto the
ass, Because thou hast
mocked me: I
would there
were a

kill thee.
\VS{30}And the

said unto
Balaam,
{\ADD{Am}} not I thine

drawn in his

down his head, and fell
flat on his

fell…: or, bowed himself}

\VS{33}And the

saw me, and
turned from
me these
three
times:
unless she had
turned from
me, surely now also I had
slain thee, and saved her
alive.
\VS{34}And

said unto the

burnt all their

ye the
heart of the

discouraged the

sware,

wander in the

forty

restore him to the
city of his
refuge, whither he was
fled: and he shall
abide in it unto the
death of the
high
priest, which was
anointed with the
holy
oil.

slayer shall at any
time
come without the
border of the
city of his
refuge, whither he was
fled;

blood:\FTNT{**}{{\FR 35.27 }
he…: Heb. no blood shall be to him}

death of the
high

after the
death of the

priest the
slayer shall
return into the
land of his
possession.

{\ADD{things}} shall be for a
statute of
judgment unto you throughout your
generations in all your
dwellings.
\VS{30}Whoso
killeth any
person, the
murderer shall be put to
death by the
mouth of
witnesses: but
one
witness shall not
testify against any
person
{\ADD{to cause him}} to
die.
\VS{31}Moreover ye shall
take no
satisfaction for the
life of a
murderer, which
{\ADD{is}}
guilty of
death: but he shall be
surely put to
death.\FTNT{††}{{\FR 35.31 }

take no
satisfaction for him that is
fled to the
city of his

again to
dwell in the
land, until the
death of the

pollute the

shed therein, but by the
