  onites sue to Joshua, who goeth to their assist-
  ance. 8 God encourageth him, and casteth

  had's daughters. 7 The coast of Manasseh

  The children of Joseph sue for and obtain an-
  other lot.

Chapter 18
1 The tabernacle is set up at Shiloh. 2 Joshua
  causeth the remainder of the land not yet di-

Chapter 22
1 Joshua dismisseth the two tribes and half with
  a blessing and a share of spoil. 10 On their
  journey they build the altar of testimony. 11
  The other tribes are offended thereat, and send
  to demand satisfaction. 21 The two tribes
  and half vindicate their conduct. 30 The
  deputies are satisfied. 32 Their report satisfieth
  the people that sent them.

  by the remembrance of former benefits, 5 by
  the prospect of future blessings, 12 and by
  threatenings in case of disobedience.

Chapter 24
1 Joshua assembleth the tribes at Shechem, 2 and

  justly requited for his cruelty. 8 Jerusalem
  taken. 10 The sons of Anak in Hebron slain.

  driven out by Manasseh, 29 by Ephraim, 30
  by Zebulun, 31 by Asher, 33 and by Naph-
  tali. 34 The Amorites force Dan into the
  mountain.

Chapter 2
1 An angel rebuketh the people at Bochim for their
  disobedience to God's command. 6 During the
  life of Joshua and of the elders who survived
  him the people serve the Lord; 10 but in the
  next generation fall away to grievous idolatry.
  14 God's anger against them. 16 His pity
  toward them in their distress, and their un-
  grateful behaviour. 20 The Canaanites are
  therefore left to prove Israel.

Chapter 3
1 The nations which were left to prove Israel.
  5 By intercourse with them the Israelites are
  seduced into idolatry. 8 They are sold into the
  hand of Chushan-rishathaim, but are delivered by
  Othniel; 12 and into the hand of Eglon king
  of Moab, but are delivered by Ehud. 31 Sham-
  gar slayeth six hundred Philistines with an ox
  goad, and delivereth Israel.

  borah stirreth up Barak to their deliverance.

  The song of Deborah and Barak

Chapter 6
1 The Israelites for their sin are oppressed by Mi-
  dian. 7 They cry to God; a prophet is sent to
  reprove them. 11 An angel sendeth Gideon to
  deliver them. 17 Gideon asketh a sign; he
  bringeth flesh, broth, and bread, to the angel,
  which are all miraculously consumed with fire.
  25 Gideon destroyeth Baal's altar and grove,
  and sacrificeth upon an altar which he built unto
  the LORD. 28 The men of his city require
  him to be put to death; his father defendeth
  him, and giveth him the name of Jerub-baal.
  33 Gideon gathereth an army to fight the Mi-
  dianites. 36 The double sign granted accord-
  ing to his prayer.

Chapter 7
1 Gideon's army of two and thirty thousand is by
  God's direction reduced to three hundred. 9 He
  is sent into the enemy's camp by night, where
  he is encouraged by hearing a dream told with
  its interpretation. 16 He divideth his army
  into three companies, giving to each man a
  trumpet, and a lamp in a pitcher. 19 On his
  approach the Midianites are thrown into con-
  fusion and put to flight. 24 The Ephraimites
  take Oreb and Zeeb, and put them to death.

Chapter 8
1 The Ephraimites are offended with Gideon: he
  pacifieth them. 4 The men of Succoth and Pe-
  nuel insolently refuse relief to Gideon's army.
  10 Zeba and Zalmunna are taken prisoners.
  13 Succoth and Penuel are chastised. 18 Gi-
  deon revengeth the death of his brethren on
  Zeba and Zalmunna. 22 He refuseth the go-
  vernment which the people offer him, but ask-
  eth for the earrings of their prey, whereof he
  maketh an ephod: which becometh a cause of
  idolatry. 28 Midian is totally subdued. 29 Gi-
  deon's children. 32 His death, and the subse-
  quent idolatry and ingratitude of the Israelites.

Chapter 9
1 Abimelech conspireth with the Shechemites, mur-
  dereth his brethren, and is made king. 7 Jo-
  tham's parable of the trees, whereby he re-
  proacheth the men of Shechem with ingratitude,
  and foretelleth their ruin. 22 The Shechemites
  conspire with Gaal against Abimelech. 30 Ze-
  bul sendeth Abimelech notice thereof; 34 who
  overcometh them, and soweth their city with
  salt. 46 The Shechemites retire to an hold of the
  god Berith, and are burned therein. 50 Abi-
  melech is slain at Thebez by a woman with a
  piece of a milstone. 56 Jotham's curse is
  fulfilled.

Chapter 10
1 Tola judgeth Israel; 3 and after him Jair,
  whose thirty sons had thirty cities. 6 The
  children of Israel fall again into idolatry. and
  are oppressed by the Philistines and Ammonites.
  10 They cry unto God, and are sent by him for
  help unto their false gods. 15 Upon their re-
  pentance he pitieth them. 17 They assemble
  and consult about chusing a head.

Chapter 11
1 Jephthah, the son of Gilead by a strange woman,
  is thrust out from home by his brethren. 4 At
  the breaking out of the war the elders of Gilead
  sue to him to command them, and covenant to
  make him their head. 12 His embassy to the
  king of Ammon, which proveth fruitless. 29
  His vow. 32 He overcometh the Ammonites.
  34 His daughter cometh to meet him, with
  whom he doeth according to his vow.

Chapter 12
1 The Ephraimites quarrel with Jephthah; are
  smitten by the Gileadites, and, being discerned
  by the word Shibboleth, are slain in great num-
  bers. 7 Jephthah dieth. 8 Ibzan, who had
  thirty sons and thirty daughters, judgeth Israel;
  11 after him Elon; 13 and Abdon, who had
  forty sons and thirty nephews.

Chapter 13
1 Israel serveth the Philistines forty years. 2
  An angel appeareth to Manoah's wife, who
  was barren, and telleth her that she shall bear
  a son. 6 She informeth her husband of it. 8
  At Manoah's prayer the angel appeareth to
  him, and instructeth him what they must do. 15
  Manoah's sacrifice, whereby the angel is dis-
  covered. 24 Samson is born.

Chapter 14
1 Samson desireth to take one of the daughters of
  the Philistines to wife. 5 In his journey to
  Timnath he killeth a lion. 8 In a second jour-
  ney thither he findeth honey in the lion's carcase.
  10 Samson's marriage feast. 12 His riddle,
  which his wife prevaileth upon him to unfold
  to her, and she discovereth to the guests. 19
  He slayeth thirty Philistines, and giveth their
  spoil to those who had expounded his riddle;
  he leaveth his wife in anger, who is given to
  another.

Chapter 15
1 Samson returning to visit his wife is denied ad-
  mittance to her. 3 He setteth fire to the corn
  of the Philistines with foxes and firebrands:
  his wife and her father are burned by the
  Philistines. 7 Samson smiteth them, and re-
  tireth to the rock Etam. 9 The Philistines
  come up against him: the men of Judah with
  his consent deliver him bound to the Philistines.
  14 He killeth a thousand of the Philistines
  with the jawbone of an ass. 18 God openeth
  a fountain in Lehi to relieve his thirst.

Chapter 16
1 Samson escapeth from Gaza by carrying away
  the gates of the city. 4 Delilah corrupted by
  the Philistines urgeth him to tell her where his
  strength lay; he thrice deceiveth her; 15 but
  is at length prevailed upon, and his head
  shaven. 21 The Philistines take him, and put
  out his eyes; but his strength is renewed as his
  hair groweth. 23 The Philistines hold a great
  feast to Dagon, and send for Samson to make
  them sport; 26 who pulleth down the house
  upon the heads of his enemies, and is slain
  with them.

Chapter 17
1 Of the money that Micah had stolen, and af-
  terward restored, his mother maketh images.
  5 Micah's idolatry. 7 He hireth a Levite to
  be his priest.

Chapter 18
1 The Danites send five men to seek out for them
  an inheritance, who come to the house of Mi-
  cah, and are encouraged by the Levite to pro-
  ceed on their way. 7 They search Laish, and
  bring back news of good hope. 11 Six hundred
  men are sent to surprize the place. 14 On the
  way they rob Micah of his consecrated things,
  and carry off his priest. 22 Micah pursueth
  them, but is obliged to return for fear of vio-
  lence. 27 Laish is surprized, taken possession
  of, and called Dan. 30 Idolatry is set up in
  Dan, where Jonathan the Levite and his
  sons have the priesthood.

Chapter 19
1 A Levite of mount Ephraim goeth to Bethle-
  hem to fetch home his concubine, and on his re-
  turn cometh to Gilbeah in the evening. 16 An
  old man entertaineth him. 22 The men of the
  city beset the house with a vile intent; to pre-
  vent which the man yieldeth up his concubine,
  who is abused by them to death. He di-
  videth her into twelve parts, which he sendeth
  to the twelve tribes of Israel.

Chapter 20
1 The children of Israel assemble at Mizpeh, be-
  fore whom the Levite declareth his wrong.
  8 The resolution of the assembly to punish the
  Gilbeathites. 12 The Benjamites, being re-
  quired to deliver up the offenders, instead of
  complying make head against the other tribes.
  18 By the direction of God Judah goeth up
  first against them; but the Israelites are re-
  pulsed with great loss. 22 They renew the
  fight the second day, and are again defeated
  with a great slaughter. 26 They seek to God
  with fasting and sacrifices, and are promised
  success. 29 They make use of a stratagem,
  and destroy all the Benjamites with all that
  belonged to them, except six hundred men, who
  flee to the rock Rimmon.

Chapter 21
1 The people bewail the desolation of Benjamin,
  and seek to repair it. 8 By the destruction of
  Jabesh-gilead they provide wives for four hun-
  dred of those who had taken shelter in the
  rock. 16 The elders consult how to find wives
  for the remainder consistently with an oath that
  had been taken, and advise the Benjamites to
  carry off by surprise the virgins that danced
  at Shiloh.

  there, as do also his sons Mahlon and Chilion,

  with her; of whom Orpah leaveth her, but
  Ruth with great constancy accompanieth her.
  19  They two come to Bethlehem, where the
  inhabitants flock around with enquiries con-
  cerning them.

Chapter 2
1 Ruth goeth by chance to glean in the fields of
  Boaz. 4 Boaz taketh notice of her, and shew-
  eth her great favour. 18 She returneth with
  what she had gotten to her mother in law, and
  telleth her what had happened.

Chapter 3
1 By Naomi's instruction 6 Ruth layeth herself in
  the night at the feet of Boaz; who acknow-
  ledgeth the duty of a kinsman, but telleth her
  of one who had a prior claim. 14 He sendeth
  her home in the morning with six measures of
  barley.

Chapter 4
1 Boaz proposeth to the nearest of kin the re-
  demption of Elimelech's land, and the marriage
  of Ruth. 6 The kinsman declineth both ac-
  cording to the manner in Israel. 9 Boaz buy-
  eth the inheritance, and accepteth Ruth for
  his wife before the people. 13 Ruth beareth
  Obed the grandfather of David. 18 The ge-
  nerations of Pharez unto David.

Chapter 1
1 Elkanah a Levite hath two wives; he goeth
  yearly to worship at Shiloh. 4 He favoureth
  Hannah, and comforteth her, when insulted on
  account of her barreness by Peninnah. 9 Han-
  nah in grief prayeth for a child, and voweth
  to give him unto the LORD. 12 Eli mista-
  king at first rebuketh, but afterward blesseth
  her. 19 God remembereth Hannah; she bear-
  eth Samuel, and stayeth at home till he is
  weaned. 24 She presenteth him to the LORD
  according to her vow.

  ledged for a prophet in Israel.

  how to send back the ark. 10 They bring it on

  19 The Beth-shemites are smitten for looking
  into the ark. 21 They send to the inhabitants
  of Kirjath-jearim to fetch it.

Chapter 7
1 The ark is brought into the house of Abinadab
  at Kirjath-jearim, where it is kept by one of
  his sons, and abideth twenty years. 3 At the
  exhortation of Samuel the Israelites solemnly
  repent at Mizpeh. 7 The people are alarmed
  with an irruption of the Philistines. 9 While
  Samuel prayeth and sacrificeth, the Lord dis-
  comfiteth the Philistines with thunder at Eben-
  ezer. 13 The philistines are subdued. 15 Sa-
  muel peaceably and religiously judgeth Israel.

Chapter 8
1 By occasion of the ill government of Samuel's sons
  the Israelites desire a king. 6 Samuel is dis-
  pleased, and prayeth; he is comforted by God, but
  withal admonished to hearken unto the people's
  request. 10 He setteth before them by God's
  command the manner in which they must ex-
  pect a king to rule over them. 19 The people
  still continue their importunity, and God di-
  recteth Samuel to yield to them.

Chapter 9
1 Saul the son of Kish is sent to see his father's
  asses which were lost, and despairing to find
  them is counselled by his servant to apply to
  Samuel. 11 He is directed by some young
  maidens where to meet with him. 15 Samuel,
  having been told by God both of his coming,
  and of his appointment to the kingdom, enter-
  taineth him at a feast with great respect;
  25 and on the morrow, after a private con-
  versation, bringeth him on his way.

Chapter 10
1 Samuel anointeth Saul, and giveth him three
  signs in confirmation of what he had told him.
  9 Saul's heart is changed; the signs come to
  pass according to Samuel's prediction; Saul
  prophesieth. 14 On his return he concealeth
  from his uncle the matter of the kingdom.
  17 The people are called together by Samuel to
  Mizpeh, where Saul is chosen king by lot.
  26 He is honourably attended by part of his
  subjects, but despised by others.

Chapter 11
1 Nahash the Ammonite making war against Ja-
  besh-gilead proposeth very reproachful terms to
  the inhabitants, who petition for a respite of
  seven days. 4 They send to Saul, who bring-
  eth them succours, and smiteth the Ammonites.
  12 The people call for the death of those who
  had vilified Saul, to which Saul will by no
  means consent. 14 His kingdom is joyfully re-
  newed to him at Gilgal.

Chapter 12
1 Samuel calleth upon the people, and receiveth
  from them an ample justification of his inte-
  grity. 6 He chargeth them with ingratitude in
  rejecting God's government, and warneth them
  against future disobedience. To convince them
  of their offence in asking a king, 18 he calleth
  for thunder and rain in the time of harvest to
  their great dismay; 20 but encourageth them
  with the assurance of divine favour, if they
  will but fear the Lord, and serve him heartily.

Chapter 13
1 Saul's select band. 3 Jonathan smiteth the Phi-
  listines' garrison, whereupon the people are
  called together to Gilgal. The Philistines
  bring a great host into the field. 6 The dis-
  tress of the Israelites. 8 Saul weary of staying
  for Samuel offereth a burnt offering. 11 His
  excuse to Samuel, who sharply reproveth him.
  17 The Philistines send out three bands of
  spoilers. 19 The policy of the Philistines in
  suffering no smith in Israel.

Chapter 14
1 Jonathan, without the knowledge of his father
  or any of the people, attended by his armour-
  bearer only, smiteth the Philistine garrison.
  15 The Philistines seized with a panic beat
  down one another. 17 Saul perceiving the tu-
  mult enquireth of God, but without waiting
  for the priest's answer setteth upon the enemy,
  and is joined by the Hebrews who were before
  with the Philistines, and by the Israelites out
  of their hiding places. 24 His unadvised ad-
  juration is a hindrance of the victory. 31 The
  people, faint for want of food, fly upon the spoil,
  and are hardly restrained from eating the blood.
  35 Saul buildeth an altar; 37 he asketh counsel
  of God, but receiveth no answer. 38 Jonathan
  taken by lot, and sentenced to die, is rescued by
  the people. 47 Saul's victories. 49 His family.

Chapter 15
1 Saul is sent to destroy Amalek. 6 He favoureth
  the Kenites; 7 smiteth the Amalekites; but
  spareth Agag and the best of the spoil. 10 His
  disobedience displeaseth the LORD. 12 Sa-
  muel denounceth unto him God's rejection of
  him. 24 Saul's fruitless humiliation. 32 Sa-
  muel beweth Agag in pieces. 34 He and Saul
  part, and meet no more.

Chapter 16
1 Samuel by God's direction goeth to Beth-lehem
  under pretence of a sacrafice. 6 Jesse's seven
  sons pass before him, but are not approved by
  God. 11 David is sent for, approved, and
  anointed. 14 An evil spirit troubleth Saul,
  who by the advice of his servants sendeth for
  David, and is relieved by his music.

Chapter 17
1 The armies of the Israelites and Philistines be-
  ing drawn out to battle, 4 Goliath cometh for-
  ward with a proud challenge. 12 David,
  sent by his father to the army to visit his bre-
  thren, 20 heareth the challenge, and expresseth
  indignation thereat. 28 Eliab his eldest bro-
  ther chideth him. 30 His words cause him to
  be brought before Saul; 32 he accepteth the
  challenge, and sheweth the grounds of his con-
  fidence. 38 He refuseth Saul's armour, and
  armed only with a sling and a stone slayeth the
  giant. 52 The Philistines are routed. 54 David
  bringeth back the head of Goliath. 55 Saul
  enquireth and taketh notice of him.

Chapter 18
1 Jonathan loveth David. 5 David's wife con-
  duct ingratiateth him with the people, and
  with Saul's servants. 6 The women's song in
  honour of his victory exciteth Saul's envy;
  10 who in his fury seeketh to kill him. 12 Saul
  feareth David for his wisdom and good success.
  17 He promiseth him his eldest daughter by
  way of a snare, but giveth her to another.
  20 He promiseth him Michal his younger
  daughter. 22 Saul setteth his servants to per-
  suade David to be the king's son in law upon
  condition of bringing a hundred foreskins of
  the Philistines; David bringeth two hundred,
  and hath Michal given him to wife. 28 Saul's
  hatred increaseth, and David's glory.

Chapter 19
1 Jonathan discloseth to David his father's pur-
  pose to kill him. 4 He persuadeth his father
  to a reconciliation. 8 Saul jealous of David's
  good success in a new war again seeketh to slay
  him; he saveth himself by flight. 11 Saul's
  messengers come to David's house to slay him;
  Michal favoureth his escape, and deceiveth her
  father by an image in the bed. 18 David
  cometh to Samuel to Naioth; he is pursued;
  the spirit of prophecy cometh upon Saul's mes-
  sengers, 23 and upon Saul.

Chapter 20
1 David consulteth with Jonathan how to pro-
  vide for his safety. 11 The friendly league
  between them confirmed by oath. 18 They
  agree upon a token. 24 David absenting him-
  self from the king's tabe is excused by Jona-
  than; Saul being enraged seeketh to kill Jo-
  nathan. 35 Jonathan informeth David of his
  danger by the token agreed on. 41 The two
  friends take a loving leave of each other.

Chapter 21
1 David cometh to Nob, and obtaineth of  Ahi-
  melech hallowed bread: Doeg is present. 8 Da-
  vid asketh for a sword, and receiveth the
  sword of Goliath. 10 He fleeth to Gath,
  where to save his life he feigneth himself mad.

Chapter 22
1 David's kindred and others resort unto him at
  Adullam. 3 At Mizpeh he commendeth his pa-
  rents to the protection of the king of Moab.
  5 Admonished by Gad he removeth to Harath.
  6 Saul complaineth of the unfaithfulness of his
  servants. 9 Doeg accuseth Ahimelech. 11 Ahi-
  melech is sent for with the priests, and an-
  swereth the charge. 17 The footmen refusing
  to slay the priests at the king's command, Doeg
  executeth it: their city Nob is destroyed. 20 A-
  biathar escaping bringeth David the news.

Chapter 23
1 The Philistines fight against Keilah; David,
  enquiring of the Lord by Abiather, smiteth
  them, and saveth Keilah. 7 Saul purposeth
  to besiege him at Keilah. 9 God sheweth him
  of Saul's coming, and the treachery of the
  Keilites. 13 He escapeth to Ziph, whither
  Jonathan cometh and comforteth him. 19 The
  Ziphites discover him to Saul, who pursueth
  him closely in Maon, 27 but is called off by
  an invasion of the Philistines. 29 David
  dwelleth at En-gedi.

Chapter 24
1 David in a cave at En-gedi cutteth off Saul's
  skirt, but spareth his life: 8 He urgeth this
  as proof of his innocency. 16 Saul acknow-
  ledgeth his fault, taketh an oath of David,
  and departeth.

Chapter 25
1 Samuel dieth: David goeth to Paran. 2 The
  characters of Nabal and Abigail. 4 David
  sendeth a message to Nabal. 10 Provoked by
  Nabal's churlish answer, he setteth forth to de-
  stroy him. 14 Abigail is informed thereof: 18 she
  meeteth David with a present, and intreateth
  his pardon. 32 David blesseth God and her
  for so timely an interposition, and dismisseth
  her courteously. 36 Nabal, stricken with her
  relation to the matter, dieth. 39 David again
  blesseth God, and marrieth Abigail and Ahinoam.
  44 His wife Michal is given to Phalti.

Chapter 26
1 Saul, informed by the Ziphites of David's abode,
  cometh against him to Hachilah. 5 David
  coming into the trench findeth Saul and his
  servants asleep; he stayeth Abishai from killing
  Saul, but taketh his spear and cruse. 13 Da-
  vid reproveth Abner's negligence, protesteth his
  own innocency, and exhorteth Saul to desist
  from pursuing him. 21 Saul acknowledgeth
  his sin, and returneth home.

Chapter 27
1 Saul hearing that David was fled to Gath seek-
  eth no more for him. 5 David beggeth Ziklag
  of Achish. 8 He invadeth some other coun-
  tries, but persuadeth Achish that he warred
  against Judah.

Chapter 28
1 Achish putteth confidence in David. 3 Saul,
  who had before destroyed the workers with fa-
  miliar spirits, 4 afraid of the host of the
  Philistines, and forsaken of God, 7 hath re-
  course to a witch at Endor, whom he persuad-
  eth to raise up Samuel. 15 Saul, being informed
  by Samuel of his approaching ruin, fainteth.
  21 The woman and his servants prevail upon
  him to take some food for his refreshment.

Chapter 29
1 David marcheth with the Philistines: their
  princes are offended therewith. 6 Achish dis-
  misseth him with commendations of his fidelity.

Chapter 30
1 The Amalekites spoil Ziklag. 3 David on his
  return is greatly distressed, but asking counsel
  of God is encouraged to pursue them. 9 He
  setteth forward, and finding an Egyptian re-
  ceiveth intelligence of the enemy. 16 Being
  conducted to them, he smiteth them, and recover-
  eth the spoil. 22 David's law of dividing the
  spoil. 26 He sendeth presents to his friends.

Chapter 31
1 The battle at Gilboa; wherein Saul's army be-
  ing defeated, and his sons slain, he and his ar-
  mourbearer kill themselves. 7 The Philistines
  take possession of the towns deserted by the Is-
  raelites. 8 They insult over the dead bodies of
  Saul and his sons. 11 The men of Jabesh-
  gilead recover the bodies by night, burn them,
  and bury their bones at Jabesh.

(2 Samuel)

Chapter 1
1 An Amalekite bringeth to David the news of
  the Israelites' defeat, and chargeth himself
  with Saul's death. 11 David and his men
  mourn thereat. 13 The Amalekite is slain
  by David's command. 17 David's lamenta-
  tion over Saul and Jonathan.

Chapter 2
1 By God's direction David goeth up with his
  company to Hebron, where he is made king over
  Judah. 5 He commendeth the men of Jabesh-
  gilead for their kindness to Saul. 8 Abner
  maketh Ish-bosheth king over Israel. 12 A
  deadly skirmish between twelve of Abner's men
  and twelve of Joab's bringeth on a battle,
  wherein the men of Israel are worsted. 18 Asa-
  hel refusing to desist from pursuing Abner is
  slain by him. 25 At Abner's motion Joab
  soundeth a retreat. 30 The loss in the action.
  32 Asahel's burial.

Chapter 3
1 During the course of the war David still wax-
  eth stronger. 2 The six sons which were born
  to him in Hebron. 6 Abner, offended by Ish-
  bosheth, threateneth to revolt to David; 12 to
  whom he sendeth to offer his service. 13 Da-
  vid refuseth to treat, till he hath first received
  back his wife Michal; who on his demand is
  restored to him. 17 Abner having communed
  with the Israelites goeth to David, by whom
  he is feasted, and sent away in peace. 22 Joab
  returning from battle is displeased with the
  king, and following Abner murdereth him trea-
  cherously. 28 David curseth Joab, 31 and
  mourneth for Abner.

Chapter 4
1 The Israelites are troubled at Abner's death.
  2 Baanah and Rechab murder Ish-bosheth, and
  bring his head to David to Hebron. 9 David
  causeth them to be put to death, and Ish-bo-
  sheth's head to be buried.

Chapter 5
1 The tribes come to Hebron, and anoint David
  king over Israel. 4 His age and reign. 6 He
  taketh Zion from the Jebusites, and, fixing his
  residence there, calleth it the city of David.
  11 Hiram sendeth him timber and workmen to
  build him a house. 13 Eleven sons are born
  to him in Jerusalem. 17 David directed by
  God smiteth the Philistines at Baal-perazim,
  22 and again at the mulberry trees.

Chapter 6
1 David fetcheth the ark from Kirjath-jearim on
  a new cart. 6 Uzzah offering to lay hold on
  it is smitten dead; on which account the ark
  being carried into Obed-edom's house bringeth
  a blessing with it. 12 David bringeth it into
  Zion, sacrificing and dancing before it, for
  which Michal despiseth him. 17 He placeth
  it in a tabernacle with sacrifices and feasting.
  20 Michal reproving David for his religious
  joy is childless to her death.

Chapter 7
1 Nathan, first approving David's purpose to
  build God an house, 4 afterward by the word
  of the LORD forbiddeth it, but with assur-
  ance of favour, 12 and a promise of especial
  blessings in his seed. 18 David's prayer and
  thanksgiving.

Chapter 8
1 David subdueth the Philistines, and maketh the
  Moabites tributary. 3 He smiteth Hadade-
  zer and the Syrians. 9 Toi king of Hamath
  sendeth his son with presents to bless David;
  who dedicateth the presents, and the spoil which
  he had taken, to God. 14 He putteth garrisons
  in Edom. 15 His good reign; a list of his
  principal officers.

Chapter 9
1 David upon enquiry is informed by Ziba of
  Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan; 5 whom
  he sendeth for, 7 and kindly entertaineth at
  his table for Jonathan's sake: 9 He restoreth
  him all the family possessions of Saul, and
  maketh Ziba his farmer.

Chapter 10
1 David's ambassadors, sent to comfort Hanun
  for his father's death, are disgracefully treated.
  6 The Ammonites strengthened by the Syrians
  are overcome by Joab and Abishai. 15 Ha-
  darezer sendeth a new army of Syrians under
  Shobach, which is defeated by David, and their
  general slain; whereupon the kings who were
  subject to Syria become servants to Israel.

Chapter 11
1 While Joab besiegeth Rabbah, 2 David com-
  mitteth adultery with Uriah's wife. 5 Bath-
  sheba conceiveth; David sendeth for Uriah
  from the army, who cometh to David, but re-
  fuseth to go down to his house. 14 He carrieth
  to Joab a letter requiring his death, is exposed
  in the front of the battle, and slain. 18 Joab
  sendeth the news of it to David. 22 The mes-
  senger's report, and David's answer. 26 Da-
  vid taketh Bath-sheba to wife, who beareth
  a son.

Chapter 12
1 Nathan's parable of the ewe lamb causeth Da-
  vid to pass sentence upon himself. 7 Nathan
  applieth the parable to David; who humbleth
  himself, and is pardoned. 15 The newborn
  child being stricken of God, David mourneth
  and prayeth for him while living, but taketh
  comfort after he is dead. 24 Solomon is born,
  and named Jedidiah. 26 Rabbah is taken by
  David, and the people thereof tortured.

Chapter 13
1 Amnon, in love with Tamar, by Jonadab's
  counsel feigneth sickness: 6 Tamar attending
  him at his request, he ravisheth her: 15 He
  hateth her, and turneth her out of his house:
  19 She retireth in grief to her brother Absa-
  lom's house. 21 David is wroth, but Absalom
  concealeth his resentment. 23 Absalom inviteth
  his brethren to a sheepshearing feast, 28 where
  Amnon is murdered by Absalom's command.
  30 David, alarmed with tidings that all his
  sons were slain, is told the truth of the matter
  by Jonadab, whose report is confirmed by the
  coming of the young men. 37 Absalom fleeth
  to Geshur; David longeth after him.

Chapter 14
1 Joab instructeth a woman of Tekoah, and send-
  eth her to the king.  4 She entertaineth the
  king with a feigned tale, the intent of which is
  to abtain leave for Absalom's return. 21 Joab
  is sent to fetch him, but he is not allowed to see
  the king. 25 Absalom's beauty; 27 his chil-
  dren. 28 After two years he getteth admit-
  tance to the king by Joab's means.

Chapter 15
1 Absalom by fair speeches and courtesies stealeth
  the hearts of the men of Israel. 7 Under pre-
  tence of a vow he obtaineth leave to go to He-
  bron: 10 where he formeth a dangerous con-
  spiracy. 13 Upon the news David fleeth from
  Jerusalem: 19 Ittai, though a stranger,
  will not leave him. 24 Zadok and Abiathar
  are sent back with the ark. 30 David and his
  company go up mount Olivet weeping. 31 He
  prayeth God to defeat Ahithophel's counsel.
  32 Hushai is sent back with instructions how
  to act for David's service.

  vid at Bahurim. 9 David's patience and for-
  bearance. 15 Hushai insinuateth himself into

  sel Absalom openly goeth in to his father's con-
  cubines.

  cording to God's appointment. 15 Hushai send-
  eth intelligence secretly to David, who in haste
  passeth over Jordan. 23 Ahithophel hangeth
  himself. 25 Amasa is made captain of Absa-
  lom's host. 27 David's friends furnish him
  with provisions at Mahanaim.

Chapter 18
1 David, having mustered his troops under three
  principal leaders, giveth them a strict charge not
  to hurt Absalom. 6 The men of Israel are smit-
  ten in the wood of Ephraim. 9 Absalom
  hanging by the hair of his head in an oak is
  slain by Joab, and cast into a pit. 18 Absa-
  lom's place. 19 Ahimaaz ahd Cushi carry tid-
  ings to David, 33 who mourneth for Absalom.

Chapter 19
1 Joab by threats forceth David to cease mourn-
  ing. 9 The Israelites are earnest to bring the
  king back. 11 David sendeth to the priests to
  incite the men of Judah. 16 Shimei making
  submission is pardoned. 24 Mephibosheth cometh
  to meet David, and complaineth of his servant's
  treachery; half his land is restored to him.
  31 Barzillai attendeth the king over Jordan,
  and is gratefully dismissed; Chimham is received
  into the king's family. 41 The men of Israel
  expostulate with the men of Judah for not call-
  ing them to take part in bringing back the king.

Chapter 20
1 Sheba revolteth with the men of Israel. 3 Da-
  vid on his return to Jerusalem shutteth up his
  ten concubines for life. 4 Amasa, made cap-
  tain of the host, is slain by Joab. 14 Joab
  pursueth Sheba to Abel. 16 By the perswa-
  sions of a wife woman Sheba's head is thrown

1 David forceth Joab to number the people.
  5 The captains after nine months and twenty
  days deliver in the number to the king. 10 Da-
  vid repenteth, and, being obliged to choose one
  plague out of three named to him, fixeth on three
  days' pestilence. 15 After the death of seventy
  thousand in Israel, at David's humble suit the
  angel is stayed from destroying Jerusalem.
  18 By Gad's direction David purchaseth Arau-
  nah's threshingfloor; and having sacrificed
  there, the plague ceaseth.

(1 Kings)

Chapter 1
1 Abishag cherisheth David in his extreme old
  age. 5 Adonijah, having gained over Joab
  and Abiathar, inviteth his friends to a feast
  in order to make himself king. 11 Nathan's
  advice to Bathsheba thereupon; 15 who moveth
  the king on the behalf of Solomon. 22 She is
  seconded by Nathan. 28 David sweareth to
  Bathsheba to make Solomon king that same day;
  32 and issueth out orders accordingly. 38 So-
  lomon is anointed and proclaimed king, the peo-
  ple rejoicing. 41 Adonijah and his guests
  hearing the news betake themselves to flight.

  tion of his good behaviour.

  recteth him how to deal with Joab, the sons
  of Barzillai, and Shimei. 10 David's death;

  him. 13 Adonijah, having perswaded Bath-
  sheba to ask for him Abishag to wife, is put to
  death by Solomon's command. 26 Abiathar
  hath his life spared, but is removed from the
  priesthood. 28 Joab, having fled to the horns

  put in Joab's room, and Zadok in Abiathar's.
  36 Shimei is confined to Jerusalem; but going
  to Gath in defiance of the king's orders is put
  to death.

Chapter 3
1 Solomon marrieth Pharaoh's daughter. 2 High
  places being in use, he sacrificeth at Gibeon.
  5 God appeareth to him in a dream there, and
  leaveth to his choice what to ask; he asketh
  wisdom, and obtaineth with it riches and
  honour. 16 His judgment between the two
  harlots maketh his wisdom renowned.

Chapter 4
1 Solomon's chief officers of state. 7 The twelve
  officers who provided for his houshold, each in

Chapter 9
1 God in a second vision maketh a covenant with
  Solomon. 10 Hiram disliketh the cities given
  him by Solomon, but maketh him a present in
  gold. 15 Solomon buildeth divers cities. 20 The
  Canaanites which remained are subjected to a
  tribute of bondservice, but the Israelites are
  reserved for more honourable offices. 24 Pha-
  raoh's daughter removeth to her house. 25 So-
  lomon's yearly solemn sacrifices. 26 His navy,
  which fetcheth gold from Ophir.

Chapter 10
1 The queen of Sheba cometh to see Solomon.
  4 Her admiration of his wisdom and magnifi-
  cence. 10 Her presents to him. 14 Solomon's
  yearly revenue in gold. 16 His golden targets
  and shields. 18 His throne of ivory. 21 His
  rich vessels. 24 Strangers bring him presents
  out of respect to his wisdom. 26 His chariots
  and horsemen. 27 The plenty of silver and
  cedars in his time. 28 Horses, chariots, and
  linen yarn, brought out of Egypt.

Chapter 11
1 Solomon's multitude of wives and concubines,
  who in his old age seduce him to idolatry.
  9 God threateneth to rend the greater part of
  the kingdom from his family. 14 Solomon find-
  eth an adversary in Hadad the Edomite, who
  had been entertained in Egypt; 23 and in
  Rezon, who reigned in Damascus; 26 and in
  Jeroboam, to whom Ahijah had prophesied the
  kingdom should be translated. 41 Solomon's
  acts, reign, and death: Rehoboam succeedeth
  him.

Chapter 12
1 The Israelites, assembled at Shechem to make
  Rehoboam king, sue to him with Jeroboam at
  their head for redress of grievances. 6 Reho-
  boam slighteth the good advice of his father's
  old counsellors, and consulteth with the young
  men, who advise to answer the people roughly.
  12 He followeth their indiscreet counsel. 16 The
  ten tribes revolting kill Adoram, and make Re-
  hoboam flee. 20 Jeroboam is made king over
  Israel. 21 Rehoboam raiseth an army to re-
  duce the revolters, but is forbidden to proceed
  by the prophet Shemaiah. 25 Jeroboam build-
  eth Shechem and Penuel. 26 He setteth up
  the idolatrous worship of the golden calves in
  Beth-el and Dan.

Chapter 13
1 A man of God out of Judah prophesieth against
  the altar in Beth-el. 4 Jeroboam's hand,
  which he put forth against him, withereth,
  but at the prayer of the prophet is restored.
  7 The prophet refuseth the king's offered enter-
  tainment, and departeth from Beth-el. 11 He
  is seduced and brought back by an old prophet,
  20 who denounceth God's judgment against
  him for his disobedience to the divine command.
  23 A lion killeth him on his way home. 26 The
  old prophet bringeth his carcase back, burieth
  it, and confirmeth his prophecy. 33 Jeroboam
  still persisteth in his evil courses.

Chapter 14
1 Abijah, Jeroboam's son, being sick, Jeroboam
  sendeth his wife in disguise with presents to en-
  quire of Ahijah the prophet. 5 Ahijah, fore-
  warned by God of her coming, denounceth God's
  judgments against Jeroboam's house. 17 Abijah
  dieth, and is buried. 19 Jeroboam dieth, and
  is succeeded by Nadab. 21 Rehoboam's wicked
  reign. 25 Shishak king of Egypt carrieth
  away much treasure from Jerusalem. 29 Re-
  hoboam dieth, and is succeeded by Abijam.

Chapter 15
1 Abijam's wicked reign. 7 He dieth: Asa suc-
  ceedeth him. 9 Asa's good reign. 16 On ac-
  count of the war between him and Baasha he
  maketh a league with Ben-hadad king of Syria,
  who causeth Baasha to desist from building Ra-
  mah; Asa with the stones thereof buildeth
  Geba and Mizpah. 23 Asa dieth, and is suc-
  ceeded by Jehoshaphat. 25 Nadab's wicked
  reign. 27 He is slain by Baasha, who succeed-
  eth him, and executeth Ahijah's prophecy a-
  gainst Jeroboam's house. 32 Baasha's wicked
  reign.

Chapter 16
1 Jehu's prophecy against the house of Baasha.
  5 Baasha dieth, and is succeeded by Elah.
  8 Zimri slayeth Elah, and succeedeth him.
  11 He executeth Jehu's prophecy against Baa-
  sha's house. 15 Omri, made king by the army,
  besiegeth Zimri in Tirzah, who in despair burn-
  eth himself. 21 The people being divided, Om-
  ri's faction prevaileth against Tibni's. 23 Omri
  buildeth Samaria. 25 After a wicked reign,
  27 he dieth, and is succeeded by Ahab. 29 A-
  hab's excessive wickedness and idolatry. 34 Jo-
  shua's curse fulfilled upon Hiel the builder of
  Jericho.

Chapter 17
1 Elijah after foretelling a long drought is sent
  by God to the brook Cherith, and fed there by
  ravens. 8 He is afterward sent to a widow
  of Zarephath, and miraculously recruiteth her
  barrel of meal and cruse of oil. 17 The wi-
  dow's son dieth, and is restored to life by Eli-
  jah's prayer: the woman believeth him to be
  sent from God.

Chapter 18
1 In the extremity of the famine Elijah is sent to
  meet Ahab. 3 Ahab and Obadiah go different
  ways in search of pasture for the cattle. 7 Eli-
  jah meeteth Obadiah, and sendeth him to call
  Ahab. 18 Ahab, after receiving a reproof,
  by Elijah's direction gathereth together all the
  prophets of Baal. 21 Elijah proposeth to
  decide by a sign from heaven between the
  LORD and Baal. 25 Baal's prophets
  invoke him in vain. 30 Elijah praying is an-
  swered by fire from heaven: the people own the
  LORD to be God: Baal's prophets are slain.
  41 Elijah giveth Ahab notice of rain, which
  he obtaineth by prayer, and runneth before
  Ahab to Jezreel.

Chapter 19
1 Jezebel threatening Elijah's life for having
  slain Baal's prophets, he fleeth to Beer-sheba.
  4 In the wilderness he groweth weary of life,
  but being twice strengthened by food brought
  him by an angel, he reacheth Horeb after
  having fasted forty days and forty nights. 9
  At Horeb God appeareth unto him, and com-
  missioneth him to anoint Hazael, Jehu, and
  Elisha. 19 He meeteth Elisha, who taking
  leave of his friends followeth him.

Chapter 20
1 Ben-hadad king of Syria, not content with
  Ahab's submissive homage, warreth against
  Samaria. 13 By a prophet's direction the
  Syrians are smitten. 22 According as the
  prophet had forewarned Ahab, the Syrians
  next year come against him in Aphek, in con-
  fidence of better success in the plain, than on
  the hills. 28 A prophet declaring it before-
  hand to be a special judgment on them, they are
  again defeated with a great slaughter. 31
  They sue submissively to Ahab, who receiveth
  Ben-hadad kindly and sendeth him away with
  a covenant of peace. 35 A prophet, having
  first by a parable brought Ahab to condemn him-
  self, denounceth God's judgment against him
  for his unseasonable lenity.

Chapter 21
1 Ahab is sore displeased at being refused the
  vineyard of Naboth. 5 Jezebel conforteth him,
  and procureth Naboth to be stoned to death
  upon a false accusation of blasphemy. 15 She
  sendeth Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.
  17 Elijah is sent to meet him, and denounceth
  God's judgments against Ahab and Jezebel for
  their wickedness. 27 Ahab humbling himself
  before God, the punishment is deferred to
  his son's days.

Chapter 22
1 Ahab perswadeth Jehoshaphat to go with him
  against Ramoth-gilead. 5 Jehoshaphat pro-
  posing to enquire of the LORD, the false
  prophets assure Ahab of success. 7 At Jeho-
  shaphat's request Micaiah is sent for: 15 who
  foretelleth Ahab's death, and sheweth that his
  false prophets were possessed by a lying spirit.
  24 He is ill treated, and sent to prison. 29
  Ahab goeth in disguise to the battle. 31 Je-
  hoshaphat being mistaken for Ahab narrowly
  escapeth being slain. 34 Ahab is killed by an
  arrow shot at a venture: the people are dis-
  persed by proclamatioin. 37 Dogs lick up
  Ahab's blood according to Elijah's prophecy.
  39 The acts of Ahab, who is succeeded by
  Ahaziah. 41 Jehoshaphat's good reign: his
  acts. 50 Jehoshaphat dieth, and is succeeded
  by Jehoram. 51 Ahaziah's wicked reign.

(2 Kings)

Chapter 1
1 Moab rebelleth. 2 Ahaziah's messengers, sent
  to enquire concerning the event of his sickness
  of Baal-zebub, are turned back by Elijah with
  a sentence of death from the LORD. 5 Aha-
  ziah, apprized of the cause of their quick return,
  sendeth to apprehend Elijah, who twice calleth
  down fire from heaven upon those that come
  against him. 13 Moved by the humble suit of
  the third captain, and encouraged by an angel,
  he goeth to the king, and assureth him of his
  approaching death. 17 Ahaziah dieth, and is
  succeeded by Jehoram.

Chapter 2
Elijah, having tried in vain to perswade Elisha
  to leave him, with his mantle divideth Jordan,
  and they both pass over on dry ground. 9 Eli-
  jah conditionally alloweth Elisha's request of a
  double portion of his spirit, and is taken up
  into heaven in a fiery chariot. 12 Elisha seeth
  it, and taking up Elijah's mantle divideth
  again the waters of Jordan, and is acknow-
  ledged for Elijah's successor. 16 The young
  prophets with difficulty obtain leave to seek for
  Elijah, and return without finding him. 19 Eli-
  sha with salt healeth the unwholesome waters of
  Jericho. 23 Bears destroy the children that
  mocked him.

Chapter 3
1 Jehoram's evil reign. 4 Mesha king of Moab
  rebelleth. 6 Jehoram with Jehoshaphat and
  the king of Edom goeth against him; being
  distressed for want of water they apply to Eli-
  sha, who promiseth them water, and assureth
  them of victory. 20 The water cometh in
  great plenty, and is mistaken by the Moabites
  for blood; they come in hopes of spoil, and are
  entirely defeated. 26 The king of Moab, fail-
  ing in his attempt to break through unto the
  king of Edom, sacrificeth his son, and raiseth
  the siege.

Chapter 4
1 Elisha miltiplieth a poor widow's oil in order to
  pay her debts. 8 He is hospitably entertained
  by a Shunammite woman, and in requital ob-
  taineth a son for her. 18 The child dieth, and
  is restored to life at Elisha's prayer. 38 He
  healeth the deadly pottage at Gilgal. 42 He
  miraculously satisfieth an hundred men with
  twenty barley loaves.

Chapter 5
1 Naaman, captain of the Syrian host, upon the
  report of a captive maid cometh to Samaria to
  be cured of his leprosy. 8 Elisha sendeth him
  to dip in Jordan, whereby he is healed. 15 Na-
  aman acknowledgeth the true God; cannot pre-
  vail on Elisha to accept his presents; asketh for
  earth; and is sent away in peace. 20 Gehazi,
  Elisha's servant, by a lie obtaineth a present
  from Naaman, and is smitten with leprosy.

Chapter 6
1 The sons of the prophets get leave to enlarge
  their dwelling: Elisha causeth the iron to swim.
  8 He discloseth and disappointeth the counsels
  of the king of Syria, 11 who sendeth troops
  to apprehend him in Dothan. 15 Elisha's ser-
  vant is terrified at seeing them, but is encou-
  raged by his master with a vision of horses and
  chariots of fire. 18 The Syrians, struck blind
  at Elisha's prayer, are conducted by him into
  the midst of Samaria, where they recover their
  sight, are kindly entertained, and dismissed in
  peace. 24 Ben-hadad besiegeth Samaria, which
  occasioneth a great famine. 26 Women eat
  their own children. 30 The king sendeth to
  slay Elisha.

Chapter 7
1 Elisha prophesieth an extraordinary plenty sud-
  denly to take place in Samaria, and sheweth an
  unbelieving lord his unhappy doom. 3 Four
  lepers venture into the camp of the Syrians,
  and bring tidings of their hasty flight. 12 The
  king, fearing a stratagem, sendeth out spies, and
  finding the report true spoileth the Syrian
  tents, which bringeth about the plenty foretold.
  17 The unbelieving lord hath the charge of the
  gate, ang being trodden to death verifieth the
  prophet's prediction.

Chapter 8
1 The Shunammite, who to avoid the famine had
  by Elisha's advice left her country seven years,
  sueth to the king, and hath her land restored to
  her. 7 Hazael, sent to enquire of Elisha con-
  cerning Ben-hadad's sickness, heareth from the
  prophet his own destination to the kingdom, and
  at his return killeth his master, and succeedeth
  him. 16 Jehoram reigneth wickedly in Judah.
  20 Edom and Libnah revolt from him. 23 He
  dieth, and is succeeded by Ahaziah. 25 Aha-
  ziah's wicked reign. 28 He assisteth Joram
  king of Israel against Syria, and visiteth him
  lying sick of his wounds at Jezreel.

Chapter 9
1 Elisha sendeth a young prophet to Ramoth-gilead
  to anoint Jehu. 4 The prophet acquitteth
  himself of his commission, and fleeth. 11 Jehu
  acquainteth the other officers with the matter,
  is proclaimed king by them, and preventeth the
  news going before him to Jezreel. 16 Jehu
  meeteth Joram and Ahaziah by the way, and
  killeth Joram, who is cast into the field of
  Naboth. 27 Ahaziah is slain at Gur, and
  buried at Jerusalem. 30 Jezebel, looking out
  of a window at Jehu's entry into Jezreel, is
  thrown down into the street, and eaten by dogs
  according to Elijah's prediction.

Chapter 10
1 Jehu by his letters causeth Ahab's seventy sons
  to be slain in Samaria. 8 He excuseth the
  fact by the prophecy of Elijah, and destroyeth all
  Ahab's kindred and friends in Jezreel. 12 In
  his way to Samaria he slayeth two and forty of
  Ahaziah's brethren. 15 He taketh Jehonadab
  in the chariot with him, and destroyeth all that
  remained unto Ahab in Samaria. 18 By
  subtilty he slayeth at once all Baal's worshippers,
  and breaketh down his images and house. 29
  Jehu followeth the sins of Jeroboam, but for
  having executed God's judgments on Ahab's
  house is promised the continuance of the king-
  dom in his family to the fourth generation.
  32 Hazael smiteth Israel. 34 Jehu dieth;
  his son Jehoahaz succeedeth him.

Chapter 11
1 Jehoash, saved by Jehosheba his aunt from the
  general massacre of the royal family of Judah
  by Athaliah, is concealed six years in the house
  of the LORD. 4 In the seventh year Jehoiada
  the high priest, having taken measures for his
  security, bringeth him forth, and crowneth
  him. 13 Athaliah pressing forward into the tem-
  ple is seized and slain. 17 Jehoiada restoreth
  the worship of God, abolisheth that of Baal,
  and fixeth the king on his throne to the great
  joy of the people.

Chapter 12
1 Jehoash reigneth well so long as Johoiada liveth.
  4 The repair of the house of the LORD
  having been first left to the priests, and neg-
  lected, Jehoash provideth more effectually for
  it. 17 Hazael is diverted from his design
  against Jerusalem by a present out of the hal-
  lowed and royal treasures. 19 Jehoash is
  slain by a conspiracy of his servants: Ama-
  ziah succeeded him.

Chapter 13
1 Jehoahaz reigneth wickedly over Israel. 3 Is-
  rael oppressed by Hazael is relieved at the prayer
  of Jehoahaz. 8 Jehoahaz dieth; Joash suc-
  ceedeth him. 10 His bad reign. 14 Elisha vi-
  sited on his death bed by Joash promiseth him
  three victories over the Syrians, whose over-
  throw had been complete but for the king's
  fault. 20 Elisha dieth; the Moabites invade
  the land; on whose appearance a dead man
  being cast into Elisha's grave is raised to life
  on touching his bones. 22 Hazael, who had
  oppressed Israel, dying, Joash thrice defeateth
  Ben-hadad, and recovereth the cities taken by
  Hazael.

Chapter 14
1 Amaziah's good reign. 5 His justice in punish-
  ing his father's murderers. 7 He smiteth Edom
  in the valley of salt. 8 His imprudent chal-
  lenge to the king of Israel: Joash sheweth him
  the folly of it, but, finding him obstinate, de-
  feateth him, and, breaking down the wall of
  Jerusalem, carrieth away the treasures found
  in it. 15 Jehoash dieth, and is succeeded by
  Jeroboam. 17 Amaziah is slain by a conspi-
  racy. 21 The people of Judah make his son
  Azariah king, who buildeth Elath. 23 Je-
  roboam's bad reign: he recovereth the coast of
  Israel. 28 He dieth: Zachariah succeedeth
  him.

Chapter 15
1 Azariah's good reign. 5 He is smitten with le-
  prosy: during his life his son Jotham govern-
  eth in his name, and at his death succeedeth
  him. 8 Zachariah, the fourth and last king
  of Jehu's race, reigneth ill, and is slain by
  Shallum; 13 who after a month's reign is
  himself slain and succeeded by Menaham. 16 Me-
  nahem cruelly smiteth Tiphsah which held out
  against him. 17 His wicked reign. 19 To
  secure himself on the throne he buyeth the alli-
  ance of Pul king of Assyria. 21 His death:
  Pekahiah succeedeth him; 23 who after a
  wicked reign of two years is slain and succeeded
  by Pekah. 27 Pekan's evil reign. 29 Tig-
  lath-pileser carrieth part of Israel into capti-
  vity. 30 Hoshea slayeth and succeedeth Pekah.
  32 Jotham reigneth well in Judah. 36 His
  acts and death: Ahaz succeedeth him.

Chapter 16
1 Ahaz reigneth very wickedly. 5 Rezin and
  Pekah make war against him 7 He hireth
  Tiglath-pileser against them, who taketh Da-
  mascus, and slayeth Rezin. 10 Ahaz causeth
  a new altar to be made for burnt offerings after
  a pattern sent by him from Damascus, and set-
  teth aside the brasen altar for his private use.
  17 He spoileth the temple of its ornaments for
  a present to the king of Assyria. 19 He dieth:
  Hezekiah succeedeth him.

Chapter 17
1 Hoshea's wicked reign. 3 Becoming tributary
  to Shalmaneser, and afterward conspiring with
  the king of Egypt against him, he is shut up
  in prison. 5 Shalmaneser after a three years'
  siege taketh Samaria, and carrieth Israel away
  captive for their wickedness, as the prophets
  had predicted. 24 The strange nations, which
  were transplanted into the land of Israel, are
  plagued with lions; they send for one of the
  captive priests to teach them the worship of God,
  which they mix with their own idolatry.

Chapter 18
1 Hezekiah's good reign. 4 He abolisheth idola-
  try, and prospereth. 9 In his time Samaria
  is taken, and Israel carried away captive for
  their sins. 13 Sennacherib invadeth Judah,
  and receiveth the appointed tribute from He-
  zekiah. 17 He sendeth Rab-shakeb, who in-
  sulteth Hezekiah, 28 and in a blasphemous
  speech solliciteth the people to revolt.

Chapter 19
1 Hezekiah in deep affliction sendeth to desire
  Isaiah's prayers. 6 Isaiah returneth an answer
  of comfort. 8 Sennacherib, being called away
  to oppose the king of Ethiopia, sendeth a blas-
  phemous letter to Hezekiah. 14 Hezekiah's
  prayer upon the receipt of it. 20 Isaiah's
  prophecy concerning the pride and overthrow
  of Sennacherib, and the prosperity of Zion. 35
  An angel destroyeth the Assyrian army: Sen-
  nacherib is slain at Nineveh by his own
  sons.

Chapter 20
1 Hezekiah, warned by Isaiah to prepare for
  death, upon his prayer is promised an addition
  of fifteen years to his life: 8 in confirmation
  whereof the shadow goeth ten degrees back-
  ward on the sundial of Ahaz. 12 Berodach-
  baladan sendeth to congratulate Hezekiah on
  his recovery, who ostentatiously sheweth the
  ambassadors his treasures. 14 Isaiah hearing
  this foretelleth the Babylonish captivity. 20 He-
  zekiah dieth: Manasseh succeedeth him.

Chapter 21
1 Manasseh's wicked reign and great idolatry.
  10 Prophecies uttered against Judah because
  of his wickedness. 17 He dieth: Amon suc-
  ceedeth him. 19 Amon's wicked reign. 23 He
  is slain by a conspiracy of his servants; the
  people slay the murderers, and make Josiah
  king. 25 Amon's acts and burial.

Chapter 22
1 Josiah's good reign. 3 He provideth for the
  repair of the temple. 8 Hilkiah having found
  a book of the law, it is read before the king;
  who is alarmed, and sendeth to the prophetess
  Huldah to enquire of the LORD. 15 Hul-
  dah prophesieth the destruction of Jeresalem,
  but not to take place till after Josiah's death.

Chapter 23
1 Josiah causeth the book to be read in a solemn
  assembly. 3 He reneweth the covenant between
  the LORD and the people. 4 He destroyeth
  idolatry in Judah. 15 He burneth men's bones
  upon the altar at Beth-el according to the pro-
  phecy, sparing the sepulchre of the prophet who
  had foretold these things. 19 He pulleth down
  the idolatrous houses in the cities of Samaria,
  and slayeth the priests. 21 He causeth a solemn
  passover to be kept. 24 He putteth away
  witches and all abominations, and excelleth in
  piety all kings before and after him. 26 God's
  determined wrath against Judah for Manasseh's
  provocations. 28 Josiah's acts: 29 he is
  slain in a battle with Pharaoh-nechoh; Jehoa-
  haz succeedeth him. 31 Jehoahaz after a
  wicked reign of three months is deposed and im-
  prisoned by Pharaoh-nechoh, who maketh Je-
  hoiakim king, and carrieth Jehoahaz to Egypt.
  35 Jehoiakim taxeth the land for Pharaoh's
  tribute. 36 His wicked reign.

Chapter 24
1 Jehoiakim first submitteth to, and afterward re-
  belleth against Nebuchadnezzar: God hasteneth
  the ruin of Judah, as foretold by the prophets.
  5 Jehoiakim dieth: Jehoiachin succeedeth him.
  7 The king of Egypt is vanquished by the king
  of Babylon. 8 Jehoiachin's wicked reign. 10 Je-
  rusalem is besieged and taken; Jehoiachin with
  his family and the chief persons of Judah are
  carried captive to Babylon. 17 Zedekiah is
  made king, and reigneth wickedly: he rebelleth
  to the utter destruction of Judah.

Chapter 25
1 Jerusalem is again besieged, 4 and taken by
  storm: Zedekiah fleeth, is taken his sons slain,
  and his own eyes put out. 8 Nebuzar-adan
  having burned the temple and all the palaces
  of Jerusalem, and broken down the walls, car-
  rieth the remnant of the people, except a few
  labourers, to Babylon. 13 He spoileth and
  carrieth away the valuable things of the tem-
  ple. 18 The nobles of Judah are slain at Rib-
  lah. 22 Gedaliah, who was set over the peo-
  ple that were left being treacherously murdered,
  the rest flee into Egypt. 27 Evil-merodach
  sheweth kindness to Jehoiachin in his captivity.

  ten tribes revolting kill Hadoram, and make
  Rehoboam flee.

  captains.

  suaded to go with him against Ramoth-gilead.

  15 who foretelleth Ahab's death, and sheweth
  that his false prophets were possessed by a lying
  spirit. 23 He is ill treated and sent to prison.
  28 Ahab goeth in disguise to the battle, where
  Jehoshaphat being mistaken for him narrowly
  escapeth being slain. 33 Ahab is slain by an
  arrow shot at a venture.

Chapter 19
1 Jehoshaphat on his return is reproved by Jehu
  for having joined in alliance with Ahab. 4 He

  hundred thousand Israelites for a hundred ta-
  lents of silver, but at the word of a prophet
  loseth the money, and dismisseth them, who de-
  part in great anger. 11 He smiteth the Edom-

  war. 16 Waxing proud he invadeth the priests'
  office, is opposed by Azariah, and smitten with

  ceedeth him.

Chapter 27
1 Jotham reigning well prospereth. 3 His build-
  ings. 5 He subdueth the Ammonites. 7 His acts,
  reign, and death: Ahaz succeedeth him.

  to Samaria, at the remonstrance of the
  prophet Oded send them home. 16 Ahaz call-
  eth the king of Assyria to his aid, but is not at
  all benefited by his assistance. 22 In his distress

  gion, and exhorteth the Levites to cleanse the
  house of God. 12 The Levites sanctify them-
  selves, and cleanse the house. 20 Hezekiah
  offereth solemn sacrifices, wherein the Levites
  show a more forward zeal than the priests.

Chapter 30

  kept in the second month, and calleth all Judah

  lously recovered; but waxing proud, he afterward
  humbleth himself. 27 His riches and works.

  down idolatry, restoring the worship of the
  true God. 18 His acts and prayer: 20 He
  dieth; Amon succeedeth him. 21 Amon's
  wicked reign; he is slain by his servants.
  25 The people slay the murderers, and make
  Josiah king.

Chapter 34
1 Josiah's good reign: 3 he destroyeth idolatry
  both in Judah and Israel: 8 he provideth for
  the repairs of the temple. 14 Hilkiah having
  found the book of the law, it is read before
  the king, who is alarmed, and sendeth to the
  prophetess Huldah to enquie of the LORD.
  23 Huldah prophesieth the destruction of Jeru-
  lem, but not to take place till after the death
  of Josiah. 29 Josiah causeth the book to be
  read in a solemn assembly, and reneweth the
  covenant between God and the people.

Chapter 35

  20 He goeth to fight with Pharaoh-necho, and
  is slain in battle at Megiddo. 25 The lamen-
  tations made for him. 26 His acts.

  rieth part of the vessels of the temple to Babylon.
  9 Jehoiachin is made king, and after a year's
  reign carried to Babylon with other vessels of
  the temple: Zedekiah is made king in his stead.
  11 Zedekiah reigneth wickedly, despiseth the
  admonitions of Jeremiah, and rebelleth against
  Nebuchadnezzar. 14 The sins of the priests
  and of the people cause the utter destruction of
  Jerusalem by the Chaldees, and the desolation of
  the land for seventy years. 22 The proclama-

  gins, but by Mordecai's directions telleth not
  her kindred. 12 The manner of purification
  and going in unto the king. 15 Esther pleaseth
  him, and is made queen. 21 Mordecai discover-
  eth a plot against the king's life which service
  is registered in the chronicles of the kingdom.

Chapter 3
1 Haman, advanced by the king, hath great respect
  paid him by all but Mordecai, on whose account
  he seeketh revenge upon the whole Jewish na-
  tion. 7 He casteth lots to fix the time for exe-
  cuting his purposes. 8 By calumniating the
  Jews he obtaineth a commission from the king
  to extirpate them.

Chapter 4
1 The great mourning of Mordecai and the Jews.
  4 Esther sendeth to Mordecai to enquire the
  reason, is informed thereof, and advised by him
  to intercede with the king for the nation.
  10 She at first excuseth herself, but being ad-
  monished of the consequences by Mordecai, 15 ap-
  pointeth a fast, and undertaketh the suit.

Chapter 5
1 Esther, venturing to appear uncalled before the
  king in the inner court, is graciously received,
  and promised the grant of her request: she in-
  viteth the king and Haman to a banquet. 6 Be-
  ing encouraged by the king to name her suit, she
  inviteth him and Haman to another banquet
  the next day. 9 Haman, though proud of the
  distinctions shewn him, repineth at and com-
  plaineth to his friends of Mordecai's neglect.
  14 By the advice of his wife and friends he
  prepareth for him a gallows.

Chapter 6
1 Ahasuerus, hearing read in the chronicles the good
  service done by Mordecai, thinketh how to re-
  ward him. 4 Haman, coming to sue that Mor-
  decai might be hanged, becometh himself the
  instrument of doing him honour. 12 Complain-
  ing of his misfortune, his friends foretell him
  of his fall.

Chapter 7
1 Esther at the banquet maketh suit to the king
  for her own life, and for the life of her people.
  5 Esther accuseth Haman. 7 The king in
  wrath, being told of the gallows prepared for
  Mordecai, causeth Haman to be hanged thereon.

Chapter 8
1 Esther having made known Mordecai's nearness
  of kin unto her, he is advanced in Haman's
  room. 3 Esther with tears maketh suit for
  the reversal of the letters gone forth against the
  Jews. 7 The king granteth authority to the
  Jews to stand upon their defence, and letters
  are issued out accordingly. 15 Mordecai's ho-
  nours, and the joy of the Jews.

Chapter 9
1 The Jews, assisted by the rulers through fear of
  Mordecai's power, slay their enemies, and the
  ten sons of Haman among the rest. 12 Aha-
  suerus at the request of Esther granteth to the
  Jews at Shushan another day of slaughter, and
  causeth Haman's sons to be hanged. 20 The
  two days of Purim are made anniversary fes-
  tivals in commemoration of this deliverance.

Chapter 10
1 The greatness of Ahasuerus, and Mordecai's
  advancement under him.

(Job)

Chapter 1
1 Job's uprightness, family, wealth, and religious
  concern for his children. 6 Satan appeareth
  before God, falsely accuseth Job, and obtaineth
  leave to tempt him. 13 Job, receiving suc-
  cessive accounts of the calamities that deprived
  him of all his substance and his children, in his
  mourning blesseth God.

Chapter 2
1 Satan appeareth again before God, and is allowed
  to make farther trial of Job. 7 He smiteth
  him with sore boils from head to foot. 9 Job
  rebuketh his wife, who moved him to curse God.
  11 Three of his friends visit him, and condole
  with him in silence.

Chapter 3
1 Job curseth the day of his birth, 11 and wish-
  eth he had never been roused out of the quiet
  sleep of the grave: 20 he complaineth of life
  because of his anguish.

Chapter 4
1 Eliphaz reproveth Job for want of religious
  trust: 7 he remindeth him that God's judg-
  ments are not for the righteous, but for the
  wicked. 12 His fearful vision, designed to
  humble the vain opinion of Man's excellency in
  the sight of his Maker.

Chapter 5
1 Eliphaz proceedeth to shew that the end of the
  wicked is certain misery: 6 that man is born
  to trouble: 8 that God should be sought to in
  times of affliction: 17 The happy end of God's
  correction.

Chapter 6
1 Job sheweth that his complaints are not cause-
  less: 8 he wisheth for death, wherein he is
  assured of comfort: 14 he reproveth his friends
  of unkindness.

Chapter 7
1 Job excuseth his desire of death by representing
  the extreme restlessness of his condition: 17 he
  expostulateth with God for so severely visiting
  him.

Chapter 8
1 Bildad sheweth God's justice in dealing with
  men according to their works: 8 he appealeth
  to antiquity to prove the certain destruction of
  the hypocrite: 20 he applieth the argument of
  God's just dealing to the case of Job.

Chapter 9
1 Job acknowledgeth God's justice, wisdom, and
  power, against which there is no contending:
  14 he disclaimeth all thought of justifying him-
  self; 20 but insisteth that a man's innocency is
  not to be judged by the good or evil that befals
  him in this world: 25 he alledgeth his own mis-
  fortunes, but will not presume to dispute with
  the author of them, who is so much above him.

Chapter 10
1 Embittered by his sufferings Job taketh more
  liberty in expostulating with God. 18 he re-
  pineth at having been brought into being, and
  prayeth for a little respite from pain before
  his death.

Chapter 11
1 Zophar sharply reproveth Job for justifying
  himself: 7 he sheweth that God's counsels are
  unsearchable; 13 and that repentance is the
  only sure way for him to recover lost happiness.

Chapter 12
1 Job censureth the arrogant pretensions of his
  friends to superior knowledge: 5 he sheweth
  that wicked men often prosper under the hand
  of God; 13 he acknowledgeth the divine wis-
  dom and omnipotency.

Chapter 13
1 Job reproveth his friends of false reasoning and
  partiality: 14 though unable to account for
  his own afflictions, he professeth his confidence
  in God: 20 he intreateth to know his sins, and
  the cause of his affliction.

Chapter 14
1 Job intreateth God's forbearance in respect of
  the shortness and troubles of life, 5 and of the
  certainty of death, which cutteth short man's
  hope: 13 he wisheth for some place of shelter,
  where to wait his appointed change: 18 all
  created beings are subject to corruption.

Chapter 15
1 Eliphaz reproveth Job of impiety in justifying
  himself: 17 he proveth from tradition the
  disquietude of wicked men.

Chapter 16
1 Job reproveth his friends of inhumanity toward
  him: 7 he pathetically describeth his unhappy
  case; 17 still protesting his innocence, for
  which he maketh appeal to God.

Chapter 17
1 Job again appealeth to God from the harsh cen-
    sures of his friends: 6 whose unmerciful deal-
    ing may astonish, but not discourage the righ-
    teous. 11 His hope is no longer in life, but in
    death.

Chapter 18
1 Bildad reproveth Job of presumption and impa-
  tience: 5 he enlargeth on the inevitable cala-
  mities of the wicked.

Chapter 19
1 Job, complaining of the repeated cruelty of his
  friends, sheweth that he hath misery enough to
  gratify it: 21 be calleth for pity; 23 pro-
  fesseth his belief of a future resurrection; 28
  and warneth his friends not to persecute him.

Chapter 20
1 Zophar sheweth in his turn the certain downfal
  and portion of the wicked.

Chapter 21
1 Job craveth to be patiently heard because of
  his strange calamities: 7 he sheweth that
  wicked men sometimes do so prosper, that they
  are tempted to forget God: 16 though at other
  times their destruction is manifest. 23 The
  happy and unhappy are alike in death. 27 The
  judgment of the wicked is in another world.

Chapter 22
1 Eliphaz sheweth that man's goodness profiteth
  not God: 5 he accuseth Job of divers sins, to
  which he imputeth his calamities: 15 he al-
  ledgeth the example of wicked men to shew that
  God's judgments at length overtake them:
  21 and exhorteth Job to repentance with pro-
  mises of mercy.

Chapter 23
1 Job longeth to appear before God, 6 in confi-
  dence of being heard with mercy, and acquit-
  ted. 8 God, though invisible, observeth our
  ways. 11 Job asserteth his own integrity;
  13 but the immutable counsel of God trou-
  bleth him.

Chapter 24
1 Job sheweth that wicked men often go unpu-
  nished, and die as all other men.

Chapter 25
Bildad asserteth the sovereignty of God, before
  whom man cannot be justified.

Chapter 26
1 Job reproveth Bildad; 5 but acknowledgeth
  God's power and wisdom to be infinite and
  unsearchable.

Chapter 27
1 Job protesteth his sincerity, and resolution to
  assert his innocence to the last, 8 seeing that
  the hypocrite is without hope: 11 he admitteth
  that even the blessings which the wicked possess
  are sometimes turned into curses.

Chapter 28
1 Job sheweth that although man may by his in-
  dustry search deep into nature, 12 yet is the
  wisdom and understanding of God's ways be-
  yond his reach, 23 being comprehended by
  God only. 28 Man's wisdom is to fear God
  and to depart from evil.

Chapter 29
1 Job calleth to mind his former prosperity and
  honour, and the worthy use he had made of it.

Chapter 30
1 Job lamenteth the change of his honour into
  extreme contempt; 15 and of his prosperity
  into the deepest distress.

Chapter 31
Job maketh a solemn protestation of his integrity
  in several duties.

Chapter 32
1 Elihu is angry with Job and his three friends.
  6 He excuseth the boldness of his youth, be-
  cause wisdom doth not always come from age:
  11 he complaineth of the weak reasonings of
  those, who, instead of confuting Job, had been
  silenced by him: 16 he sheweth his own zeal to
  speak, 21 which he professeth to do without
  respect of person.

Chapter 33
1 Elihu offereth himself instead of God to reason
  with Job in sincerity without terrifying him:
  8 he blameth him for insisting so much upon his
  innocence, and for his complaints against God,
  who is not accountable to man for his doings.
  14 God instructeth and calleth man to repent-
  ance by night visions, 19 by afflictions, 23 and
  by the agency of his ministers. 31 Elihu be-
  speaketh Job's farther attention.

Chapter 34
1 Elihu chargeth Job with arraigning God's
  justice; 10 whose sovereign perfections suffer
  him not to be unjust. 31 Man ought to humble
  himself before God. 34 Job is blamed for his
  rash discourses.

Chapter 35
Elihu again reproveth Job of setting up his own
  righteousness against God's, between whom
  and man there is no comparison. 6 The good
  or evil actions of men extend not to God. 9
  If God heareth not the cry of the afflicted, it
  is because they address him not as they ought.
  14 The application of this doctrine to the case
  of Job.

Chapter 36
1 Elihu proceedeth to shew that God is just in all
  his ways. 8 The end of God's chastisements,
  and the happiness of making a right use of
  them. 12 The danger of not profiting by
  them. 16 God's mercy hindered by Job's
  offence: 18 he is exhorted to repentance. 22
  God's power uncontroulable. 24 His works
  are to be magnified, but cannot be comprehended.

Chapter 37
1 God is terrible in his great works: 15 his
  wisdom is unsearchable in them: 23 the excel-
  lence of his perfections ought to impress men
  with lowly fear.

Chapter 38
1 God out of the whirlwind challengeth Job to
  answer; 4 and by an enumeration of his
  mighty works convinceth Job of ignorance,
  31 and weakness.

Chapter 39
God proceedeth to shew his own power, and man's
  weakness and ignorance, by instances from the
  animal creation: 1 of the wild goats and
  hinds; &c.

Chapter 40
1 God challengeth an answer. 3 Job humbleth
  himself. 6 God calleth upon Job to shew by
  instances of power that he is able to save him-
  self. 15 God's great power is seen in the
  behemoth.

Chapter 41
God's great power seen in the leviathan.

Chapter 42
1 Job submitteth himself unto God. 7 God pre-
  ferreth Job's cause, and maketh his three
  friends submit themselves to him. 9 He accept-
  eth Job, and doubleth his blessings upon him.
  13 Job's children. 16 His age and death.

(Ecclesiastes)

Chapter 1
1 The preacher sheweth that all things here
  below are vain, 4 because the creatures are
  restless in their courses, 9 and there is nothing
  new brought forth, but the old things are for-
  gotten. 12 He sheweth it by his own experi-
  ence to be so in the studies of wisdom.

Chapter 2
1 The vanity which the Preacher found in the
  pursuits of pleasure. 12 Wisdom excelleth
  folly, yet like event happeneth to both. 18
  The vanity of human labour, the fruit of
  which must soon be left to a man knoweth not
  whom. 24 Nothing better than a cheerful use
  of what a man hath gotten; but that is the
  gift of God to the good only.

Chapter 3
1 By the necessary change of times vanity is added
  to human travail. 11 There is a fitness in
  God's works, which man cannot thoroughly
  find out. 12, 22 Man's object is to enjoy present
  good, so far as God alloweth whose counsels
  are immutable. 16 From the abuses of hu-
  man judicatures, God's judgment is inferred.
  18 Men and Beasts are visibly alike in their
  mortal bodies; 21 their spirits, which go dif-
  ferent ways, are unknown.

Chapter 4
1 The vanity of human life increased by oppres-
  sion; 4 and by envy. 5 The absurdity of idle-
  ness. 6 The good of contentment. 7 The
  folly and misery of covetousness. 9 The ad-
  vantages of society. 13 The throne of kings
  is not exempt from vanity and vexation.

Chapter 5
1 Cautions against abuses in divine service;
  8 against murmuring at oppression. 9 The
  vanity of riches. 18 The cheerful enjoyment
  of what a man hath is good, and the gift of
  God and a blessing to him that hath it.

Chapter 6
1 The vanity and misery of riches to one that
  wanteth an heart to use them; 3 to whom,
  although he hath many children and long life,
  an untimely birth is preferable. 7 The vanity
  of insatiable desires. 10 From the past, which
  is known, the vanity of man is seen; the
  future is unknown.

Chapter 7
1 Remedies against the vanity of life are, a good
  name, 2 mortification, 7 patience, 11 wis-
  dom, or a considerate and prudent conduct.
  23 The difficulty of getting wisdom. 25 The
  result of the Preacher's researches.

Chapter 8
1 True wisdom inspireth modesty. 2 Kings are
  to be respected. 6 Man's ignorance of futu-
  rity; 8 his inability in the day of death. 11
  The common abuse of God's forbearance. 12
  Good and bad men will surely meet with their
  deserts in the end, though it fall out otherwise for
  a time. 15 Cheerful enjoyment of present good
  commended. 16 God's work is unsearchable.

Chapter 9
1 Like things happen on earth to good and bad
  men. 4 With the living is hope, but the dead
  have no more concern with this world. 7 An
  exhortation cheerfully to enjoy the goods of life,
  and to act with vigour, while the time serveth
  11 Human probabilities are not always justi-
  fied by the event. 13 Wisdom is better than
  strength.

Chapter 10
1 Observations on wisdom and folly; 16 on the
  defects and virtues of governors; 18 on sloth-
  fulness; 19 on money. 20 Men's thoughts of
  kings ought to be reverent.

Chapter 11
1 Exhortations to charitableness. 7 Death ought
  to be remembered in life, 9 and the day of
  judgment in the days of youth.

Chapter 12
1 The Creator to be remembered in due time.
  8 The Preacher's care to edify. 13 The ge-
  neral conclusion, That Man's chief concern is
  to fear God, and obey his laws.

(Song of Solomon)

Chapter 1
1 The church's love unto Christ: 5 she confesseth

  justice. 26 The executioners of God's judg-
  ments.

1 Isaiah's vision of the Lord in his glory: 5

  people unto their destruction. 13 A remnant
  shall be saved.

  hand of the Assyrians.

(Jeremiah)

Chapter 1
1 The time when Jeremiah prophesied. 4 His
  calling and commission. 11 His visions of an
  almond tree and a seething pot, denoting God's
  speedy judgments against Judah. 17 He is en-
  couraged with a promise of God's assistance.

Chapter 2
1 God reminding the Jews of his former kindness
  esxpostulateth with them on their causeless and
  unexampled revolt. 14 They are the authors of
  their own calamities. 18 God upbraideth them
  with their fondness for idolatrous worship.
  35 The vain confidences of Judah are rejected.

Chapter 3
1 God inviteth Judah to return to him notwith-
  standing her vile whoredom. 6 Israel, though
  rejected for her lewdness, is still less criminal
  than Judah. 12 Both are called to repentance
  upon the promises of the Gospel. 20 The people
  reproached with their unfaithfulness make a so-
  lemn confession of their sins.

Chapter 4
1 Israel is excited to repentance by promises, 3 and
  Judah by threats of hostile invasion and the
  calamities of war. 19 The prophet lamenteth
  bitterly the afflictions of his country.

Chapter 5
1 The judgments of God upon the Jews for their
  universal depravity and incorrigibleness; 7 for
  their adultery; 10 their blasphemous impiety;
  15 their worship of strange Gods; 20 their
  injustice and oppression for want of fearing
  the true God; 30 and their prevarication in
  religion.

Chapter 6
1 The enemies sent against Judah are eager to
  fall upon her. 6 God directeth the siege be-
  cause of her sins. 9 the prophet lamenteth the
  evils that would follow from the corrupt man-
  ners that prevailed: 18 he proclaimeth God's
  judgments: 26 he calleth the people to mourn
  for the impending calamities.

Chapter 7
1 Jeremiah is sent to call the Jews to repentance
  in order to prevent their captivity. 8 Their
  vain confidence rejected after the example of
  Shiloh. 17 God threateneth them for their
  idolatry: 21 he requireth not the sacrifices of
  the disobedient. 29 A call to mourning for
  the abominations in Tophet: 32 Judgments
  denounced because of them.

Chapter 8
1 The calamities of the Jews, both of the dead
  and the living. 4 The prophet upbraideth
  their stubborn and shameless impenitency: 13 he
  sheweth God's severe judgments against them;
  18 and bewaileth the misery of his people.

Chapter 9
1 The prophet bewaileth the manifold sins of his
  people, 9 and the judgments coming upon them:
  12 he sheweth that disobedience is the cause of
  their calamity: 17 he exhorteth them to la-
  ment over their desolation 23 and not to trust
  in human abilities, but in knowing God: 25
  he threateneth the Jews and their neighbours.

Chapter 10
1 The great disparity between God and idols.
  17 The prophet warneth to prepare for a re-
  moval out of the land: 19 he lamenteth over
  the spoil and desolation of it: 23 he prayeth
  God to correct his people with moderation,
  and to turn his fury upon the heathen that
  wasted them.

Chapter 11
1 The prophet proclaimeth God's covenant, and
  rebuketh the Jews for disobeying it: 11 he de-
  nounceth evil against them for their idolatries,
  18 and against the men of Anatboth, who de-
  vised his death.

Chapter 12
1 Jeremiah complaining of the prosperity of the
  wicked prayeth against them. 5 God sheweth
  him what ill usage he might expect from others,
  seeing his own kindred dealt so ill with him.
  7 God lamenteth the desolation of his heritage;
  14 he threateneth their evil neighbours, but
  promiseth restoration and grace to the penitent.

Chapter 13
1 Under the type of a linen girdle hidden at
  Euphrates God prefigureth the destructioin of
  his people. 12 Under the parable of bottles
  filled with wine he foretelleth their excess of
  misery. 15 He exhorteth them to prevent
  their impending judgments by repentance: 22
  and sheweth that their abominations are the
  cause of these evils.

Chapter 14
1 A grievous dearth. 7 The prophet's prayer. 10
  God will not be intreated for the people. 13
  Both the lying prophets, and the people who
  believe them, shall perish. 17 Jeremiah is com-
  manded to bewail their calamities.

Chapter 15
1 The determined rejection and manifold judg-
  ments of the Jews. 10 Jeremiah complaining
  that he is the object of universal hatred, God
  promiseth good to him amidst the general cala-
  mity. 15 He complaineth of the evils he under-
  went for God's sake. 19 God promiseth to
  support and favour him in the due discharge of
  his office.

Chapter 16
1 Under the types of the prophet's abstaining from
  marriage, and from the houses of feasting and
  mourning, the utter ruin of the Jews is fore-
  shewed; 10 and that because they were even
  worse than their fathers. 14 Their return
  from captivity shall be more memorable than
  their deliverance out of Egypt. 16 God will
  recompense their idolatry double, and the Gen-
  tiles shall turn to God.

Chapter 17
1 The captivity of Judah for her sin. 5 Trust
  in man is cursed, in God is blessed. 9 The
  heart, though deceitful, cannot impose upon God.
  12 In God alone is sure salvation. 15 The
  prophet complaining of scoffers prayeth God to
  support him: 19 he is sent to exhort to a due
  observation of the sabbath.

Chapter 18
1 Under the type of a potter is shewed God's ab-
  solute power in disposing of nations. 11 Judah
  is threatened with judgments for her unex-
  ampled revolt. 18 Jeremiah prayeth against
  them that devised his death.

Chapter 19
Under the type of breaking a potter's vessel is
  foreshewed the desolation of the Jews for their
  sins.

1 Pashur smiting Jeremiah receiveth a  new name
  and a fearful doom. 7 Jeremiah complaineth
  of the persecutions he met with, 14 and cur-
  seth the day of his birth.

Chapter 21
1 Zedekiah sending to Jeremiah to enquire the
  event of Nebuchadrezzar's war against him,
  3 the prophet foretelleth a calamitous siege,
  and desolation in the end; 8 he counselleth the
  people to fall to the Chaldeans: 11 he exhort-
  eth the king's house to execute right judgment,
  with threats against those that trusted in the
  strength of their situation.

  justice without oppression, enforced with promises

  enings of the true ones.

Chapter 24
1 Under the type of good and bad figs 4 the pro-
  phet foresheweth the restoration of them that
  were in captivity, 8 and the desolation of Ze-
  dekiah and the residue of Jerusalem.

Chapter 25
1 Jeremiah, reproving the Jews for disregarding
  God's messages by his prophets, 8 foretelleth the
  seventy years' captivity, 12 and the succeeding
  destruction of Babylon. 15 Under the figure
  of the cup of God's fury he foresheweth the
  overthrow of divers nations. 34 The howl-
  ing of the shepherds.

Chapter 26
1 Jeremiah exhorting the people with severe
  threats to repentance 8 is apprehended, and
  arraigned before the princes for so doing: 12
  his apology: 16 he is acquitted by the exam-
  ple of Micah and Urijah, and the assistance of
  Ahikam.

Chapter 27
1 Under the type of bonds and yokes Jeremiah
  prophesieth the subjection of the neighbouring
  kings to Nebuchadnezzar, and exhorteth them
  to submit quietly, and to give no heed to false
  prophets: 12 he adviseth the like to Zedekiah:
  16 he warneth the priests and the people not
  to credit lying prophecies; 19 and sheweth that
  the remainder of the sacred vessels shall be car-
  ried to Babytlon, and there continue until the day
  of visitation.

Chapter 28
1 Hananiah's false prophecy of the return of the
  vessels and captives from Babylon within two
  years. 5 Jeremiah, wishing it to be true, ap-
  pealeth to the event. 10 Hananiah breaketh
  the yoke off Jeremiah's neck. 12 Jeremiah
  under the type of an iron yoke confirmeth the
  prophecy of the subjection of the nations to the
  king of Babylon. 15 He foretelleth Hana-
  niah's death.

Chapter 29
1 Jeremiah by letter adviseth the captives in
  Babylon to live quietly there, 8 and not to be-
  lieve the illusions of their false prophets: 10 he
  assureth them of a gracious return after seventy
  years, 15 and foretelleth the destruction of those
  that remained at Jerusalem. 20 He sheweth
  the fearful end of two of their lying prophets.
  24 Shemaiah having written a letter from
  Babylon against Jeremiah, 30 his doom is
  likewise foretold.

Chapter 30
1 God sheweth Jeremiah the return of the Jews,
  4 and their deliverance out of their trouble.

  the Jews a gracious reestablishment in their
  ancient privileges. 23 Wrath shall fall on
  the wicked.

  ing is comforted. 18 Ephraim repenting is
  received into favour. 22 The miracle of
  Christ's birth promised as a means of blessing
  to Judah. 27 God's care for his church.

  only. 31 The new covenant with Israel. 35
  The stability of God's favour to them. 38
  The extent of the city when it shall be built.

Chapter 32
1 Jeremiah, imprisoned by Zedekiah for foretell-
  ing the taking of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans,
  6 by God's direction buyeth Hanameel's field.
  13 Baruch is charged to keep the evidences safe,
  as tokens of the people's return. 16 Jeremiah in
  prayer expostulateth with God. 26 God confirm-
  eth his threats against Judah for their sins,
  36 and his promise of a gracious return.

Chapter 33
1 God reneweth his promise to the captive Jews
  of a gracious return, 10 a joyful state, 12
  and settled peace. 15 Christ, the Branch of
  righteousness, is promised. 17 and a perpetuity
  of the kingdom and priesthood. 19 The stabi-
  lity of God's covenant with David and with
  the Levites; 23 and of his promise to bring
  back Israel and Judah.

Chapter 34
1 Jeremiah prophesieth the destruction of Jeru-
  salem, and the fate of Zedekiah. 8 The
  princes and people having according to covenant
  let their bondservants go free, afterward reas-
  ume them: 12 Jeremiah proclaimeth liberty
  to the sword, the pestilence, and the famine,
  and prophesieth the return of the Babylonians
  to execute vengeance upon them.

Chapter 35
1 By the obedience of the Rechabites to their fa-
  ther's command 12 the disobedience of the
  Jews to God's commands is condemned. 18 God
  blesseth the Rechabites.

Chapter 36
1 Jeremiah causeth Baruch to write all his
  threatening prophecies in a roll of a book, and
  to read them publickly. 11 The princes send
  for Baruch to bring the roll, who readeth it
  before them: they are afraid, and counsel
  Baruch and Jeremiah to hide themselves: 20
  they tell the king of the roll, who having
  heard part of it casteth it into the fire. 27
  Jeremiah is commanded to write the same in
  another roll, and denounceth a heavy judgment
  against the king. 32 Baruch writeth a new
  copy with additions.

Chapter 37
1 The Egyptians having caused the Chaldeans to
  raise the siege of Jerusalem, Zedekiah sendeth
  to desire Jeremiah's prayers. 6 Jeremiah
  prophesieth the certain return and victory of
  the Chaldeans: 11 he is taken up for a fugi-
  tive, beaten, and put in prison: 16 he assureth
  Zedekiah of the captivity, and intreating for
  his liberty obtaineth some indulgence.

Chapter 38
1 Jeremiah, accused of disheartening the people
  by his prophecies, is cast into the dungeon of
  Malchiah; 7 out of which he is taken at the
  suit of Ebed-melech. 14 in a secret confer-
  ence he counselleth the king to save himself and
  the city by submitting to the Chaldeans. 24

  the princes the matter of the conference.

  and, his eyes being put out, is sent in chains to

  remiah meeteth with kind usage. 15 God's pro-
  mise to Ebed-melech.

Chapter 40
1 Jeremiah, being set at liberty by Nebuzar-adan,
  goeth to Gedaliah. 7 The dispersed Jews resort
  to Gedaliah. 13 Johanan revealing Ishmael's
  conspiracy is not believed.

Chapter 41
1 Ishmael having tracherously slain Gedaliah and
  others purposeth to flee with the rest unto the
  Ammonites. 11 Johanan goeth against him,
  and having recovered all the captives is minded
  to flee into Egypt.

Chapter 42
1 Johanan and the other captains desire Jeremiah
  to enquire of God for them, promising implicit
  obedience to his directions. 7 Jeremiah assureth
  them of safety in Judea, but of destruction in
  Egypt: 19 he reproveth their hypocrisy in asking
  counsel of God, which they meant not to follow.

Chapter 43
1 Johanan and the captains discrediting Jere-
  miah's prophecy carry him and the rest of the
  people into Egypt. 8 Jeremiah by a type prophe-
  sieth the conquest of Egypt by the Babylonians.

  had befallen Judah for idolatry, reproveth the
  Jews in Egypt for persisting therein, 11 and

  that the treatment of both son and father shall
  be according to their respective deserts: 21 and

  manners. 33 He threateneth to rule over them

1 The destruction of Jerusalem. 4 Under the
  type of Zechariah is shewed Christ's care for
  the flock, the Jews; and their rejection for
  ingratitude and light estimation of him. 15
  The type and curse of a foolish shepherd.

Chapter 12
1 Jerusalem a cup of trembling, and burdensome
  stone to the confusion of her adversaries. 6
  The victorious restoring of Judah. 10 The
  repentance of Jerusalem.

Chapter 13
1 The fountain of purgation for Jerusalem. 2
  The extirpation of idolatry and false prophecy.
  7 The death of Christ, and the saving of a
  third part after a severe trial.

Chapter 14
1 The destruction of Jerusalem. 3 The coming
  of Christ, the graces of his kingdom, and the
  restoration of Jerusalem. 12 The plague of
  Jerusalem's enemies. 16 The remnant shall
  turn to the LORD. 20 The holiness of all
  that belongeth to them.

(Malachi)

Chapter 1
1 God by Malachi complaineth of Israel's ingra-
  titude, 6 and of the profane disrespect shewn
  to God's worship. 14 The curse of corrupt
  offerings.

Chapter 2
1 The priests are sharply reproved for profaning
  the covenant which was given them; 10 and
  the people for marrying strange wives, 13 and
  treacherously putting away their former ones;
  17 and for impiety.

Chapter 3
1 The forerunner, and coming of the Messiah to
  cleanse his church, and to judge the wicked.
  7 The people are warned to repent, and turn
  from their sins, 8 particularly their sacrilege,
  13 and impious blasphemy. 16 God's blessing
  promised to those that fear him.

Chapter 4
1 God's judgment on the wicked, 2 and his
  blessing on the good: 4 he exhorteth to the
  study of the law; 5 and telleth of Elijah's
  coming and office.

[Apocrypha]

(1 Esdras)

Chapter 1
1 Josias causeth a solemn passover to be kept:
  25 He goeth to fight with the king of Egypt;
  is slain, and much lamented. 34 His successors
  unto Zedechias, in whose reign the temple
  and city of Jerusalem are destroyed, and the
  people that survived carried captives to Babylon.

Chapter 2
1 The proclamation of Cyrus for building the tem-
  ple. 8 The Jews provide for their return.
  10 Cyrus restoreth the holy vessels. 16 Ar-
  taxerxes moved by letters from the enemies of
  the Jews putteth a stop to the building.

Chapter 3
1 Darius maketh a great feast. 4 Three young
  men of his guard contend in wise speeches:
  13 the king and his princes sit in judgment
  upon them. 18 The first declareth the
  strength of wine.

Chapter 4
1 The second declareth the might of a king. 13
  The third, who is Zorobabel, declareth the
  power of women, 33 and of truth. 41 He is
  judged victorious, and obtaineth letters of the
  king for building Jerusalem. 58 He blesseth
  God, and sheweth his brethren the joyful news.

Chapter 5
1 The return of the Jews. 4 The names and
  number of them that returned. 47 The altar
  set up, and sacrifices renewed. 56 The founda-
  tion of the temple is laid. 66 The enemies of
  the Jews offer to join in building it, and, being
  refused, hinder it for a time.

Chapter 6
1 The prophets stir up the people to build the
  temple, their neighbours in vain interposing.
  7 The copy of the letter sent to Darius con-
  cerning it. 23 Darius after inquiry sendeth
  letters to further the work.

Chapter 7
1 Sisinnes and others assisting, the temple is finish-
  ed, and dedicated. 10 The passover is kept.

Chapter 8
1 Esdras goeth up to Jerusalem. 8 The com-
  mission of Artaxerxes to him: 25 He blesseth
  God. 28 The number and names of those that
  went with him: 50 their fast: 54 the holy
  treasures given in charge to the priests. 61
  The arrival of Esdras with his company at
  Jerusalem. 68 He lamenteth the strange mar-
  riages; 92 and is encouraged to reform the
  abuse.

Chapter 9
1 Esdras assembleth and exhorteth the people.
  10 They promise to put away their strange
  wives. 14 The reformation is made. 18 The
  names of those that had married strange wives.
  38 The law is read and expounded to the people:
  49 the people weep, and are comforted because
  of the feast.

(2 Esdras)

Chapter 1
1 Esdras is sent to reprove the people for their
  sins. 24 God threateneth to cast them off,
  35 and give their houses to others better than
  they.

Chapter 2
1 God complaineth of his people; 10 yet directeth
  Esdras to comfort them. 33 They refusing to
  hear, the Gentiles are called. 42 Esdras's
  vision of the Son of God, and of those that
  are crowned by him.

Chapter 3
1 Esdras, troubled in thought, expostulateth with
  God, confessing the sins of the people, but com-
  plaining that the heathen, who were more
  wicked, were lords over them.

Chapter 4
1 The angel sheweth Esdras his inability to com-
  prehend God's ways, and adviseth him not to
  meddle with things above his reach. 22 Esdras
  asketh divers questions, and receiveth answers
  to them.

Chapter 5
1 The signs of the times to come. 16 Esdras
  sendeth Salathiel away, and fasteth seven days.
  21 He asketh why God, choosing but one peo-
  ple, did cast them off: 31 He is taught that
  God's judgments are unsearchable, and that
  God doeth not all at once.

Chapter 6
1 Esdras is taught that God's purpose is eternal.
  7 The next world shall follow this immediately.
  11 What shall fall out in the latter times. 29
  He is promised more knowledge, and fasteth
  other seven days: 36 he reckoneth up the
  works of the creation, 57 and complaineth of
  the present condition of God's people.

Chapter 7
1 The angel sheweth that the entrances of this
  world are narrow and difficult: he accounteth
  for God's judgments; 26 fortelling the mani-
  festation of Christ, his death, and resurrection,
  and the general judgment. 36 The reasons why
  in that day there shall be no intercession. 46
  Esdras supposing that Man had better not have
  been, his doubts are cleared up. 62 Esdras
  acknowledgeth God's moral perfections.

Chapter 8
1 Many created, but few saved. 4 Esdras ex-
  postulateth with God, and prayeth for his peo-
  ple. 37 He is told that all seed cometh not to
  good. 42 He prayeth again, 46 and is an-
  swered that good will be to him, and to such
  as be like him, but evil to the wicked.

Chapter 9
1 Esdras is taught who shall be saved, and who
  not. 14 He replieth, and is told that the
  world is corrupted, but God will spare a few.
  23 He is sent into a field, where after seven
  days he complaineth that those which received the
  law perish. 38 He seeth a woman lamenting.

Chapter 10
1 The woman in the field sheweth the cause of
  her grief. 5 Esdras chiding and comforting
  her, 25 she vanisheth, and a city appeareth in
  her place. 28 At his request the angel explain-
  eth the vision.

Chapter 11
1 Esdras seeth in his dream an eagle coming out
  of the sea, 37 and a lion out of a wood talk-
  ing to the eagle.

Chapter 12
1 The eagle is destroyed. 7 Esdras prayeth; 10
  the vision is interpreted to him: 37 he is bid
  to write his visions, and to wait for more. 40
  The people come to him in grief for his absence,
  he comforteth and dismisseth them.

Chapter 13
1 Esdras in a dream seeth a man coming out of
  the sea. 25 The meaning of the vision: 54 he
  is commended, and promised more instruction.

Chapter 14
1 A voice out of a bush calleth Esdras, 10 tell-
  ing him that the world waxeth old. 19 He pray-
  eth, because the law was burned, that he may
  write all anew, 23 and is ordered to get swift
  writers. 27 He exhorteth the people; 37 He
  and the writers are filled with understanding.
  45 He is charged to publish part of what was
  written, and to conceal part.

Chapter 15
1 The certainty of prophecy. 5 God will
  take vengeance upon the wicked, 10 and upon
  Egypt. 14 The judgment of the world. 28
  An horrible vision from the east. 43 Babylon
  and Asia threatened.

Chapter 16
1 Babylon and other places are threatened with
  plagues that cannot be avoided, 23 and with
  desolation. 40 The servants of the Lord must
  look for troubles: 51 and not hide their sins,
  74 but leave them; and they shall be delivered.

(Tobit)

Chapter 1
1 Tobit's descent and piety from his youth: 9 his
  marriage, captivity, and advancement; 14 he
  leaveth money in trust with Gabael in Media:
  16 his alms, and charity in burying the dead:
  19 he is accused, fleeth, and is spoiled of his
  goods: 22 he returneth to Nineve.

Chapter 2
1 Tobit leaveth his meat to bury the dead; 9 he
  becometh blind: 11 his wife taketh in work to
  get her living: 13 they fall out about a kid.

Chapter 3
1 Tobit grieved with his wife's taunts prayeth.
  7 Sara reproached by her father's maids prayeth
  at the same time. 16 An angel is sent to their
  relief.

Chapter 4
1 Tobit giveth instructions to his son Tobias, 20
  and telleth him of the money left with Gabael
  in Media.

Chapter 5
1 Tobias going to seek a guide meeteth the angel,
  who agreeth to go with him: 7 he bringeth
  him to his father, who is satisfied with the
  account given by the angel of his kindred: 16
  Tobias departeth with the angel: 17 his mo-
  ther is grieved; Tobit comforteth her.

Chapter 6
1 The angel biddeth Tobias to preserve the liver,
  heart, and gall, of a fish he had taken; 6 and
  sheweth the use of them: 9 he adviseth Tobias
  to marry Sara, Raguel's daughter; 15 and
  teacheth him how to drive away the evil spi-
  rit that infested her.

Chapter 7
1 Tobias is kindly received by Raguel: 9 he ask-
  eth for Sara, and is told what had happened
  unto her: 12 she is given to him in marriage:
  15 her mother bringing her to her chamber
  comforteth her.

Chapter 8
1 Tobias driveth away the evil spirit, as he was
  taught: 4 he and his wife rise up and pray.
  9 Raguel, thinking he was dead, maketh a grave,
  but finding him alive, 15 he praiseth God,
  19 and maketh a wedding feast.

Chapter 9
1 Tobias sendeth the angel unto Gabael for the
  money: 6 The angel bringeth Gabael to the
  wedding.

Chapter 10
1 Tobit and his wife are anxious for their son.
  10 Raguel sendeth away Tobias and his wife,
  giving him half his goods, 11 and his blessing.

Chapter 11
1 Tobias on his return is espied by his mother.
  7 The angel adviseth him how to heal his fa-
  ther; 10 who meeting him at the door recover-
  eth his sight. 14 He praiseth God, and wel-
  cometh his daughter in law. 18 The wedding
  is kept with joy.

Chapter 12
1 Tobit at his son's motion offereth the angel half
  of what he had brought. 16 The angel ex-
  horteth them, and discovering himself appear-
  eth to them no more.

Chapter 13
The thanksgiving unto God, which Tobit wrote.

Chapter 14
1 Tobit in his old age instructeth his son, and
  chargeth him to leave Nineve. 11 He and
  his wife die, and are buried by Tobias; who re-
  moveth to Ecbatane. 14 and dieth there, hav-
  ing first heard of the destruction of Nineve.

(Judith)

Chapter 1
1 Arphaxad fortifieth Ecbatane. 5 Nabuchodo-
  nosor maketh war against him, and calleth the
  nations to his aid: 11 they slight his message;
  he threateneth them: 13 he defeateth and kill-
  eth Arphaxad, and returneth to Nineve.

Chapter 2
1 Nabuchodonosor resolved on vengeance sendeth
  Holofernes against the west country, with orders
  to spare none that will not yield: 15 his army
  and provision. 21 The places which he won
  and wasted as he went.

Chapter 3
1 They of the sea coasts sue for peace, and re-
  ceive Holofernes: 8 yet he destroyeth their
  gods, that they might worship Nabuchodono-
  sor only: 9 He cometh near to Judea.

Chapter 4
1 The Jews are afraid of Holofernes, 4 and
  fortify the hills: 6 They of Bethulia are charg-
  ed to keep the passages: 9 All Israel betake
  themselves to fasting and prayer.

Chapter 5
1 At Holofernes' enquiry Achior relateth who
  the Jews are, and what God had done for
  them, and adviseth not to meddle with them.
  22 All that heard him are greatly offended
  at him.

Chapter 6
1 Holofernes with impious vaunting 5 threateneth
  Achior, 10 and sendeth him to the Bethulians:
  14 They receive and hear him: 18 They betake
  themselves to prayer, and comfort Achior.

Chapter 7
1 Holofernes besiegeth Bethulia. 8 By advice of
  the captains of the neighbouring nations he
  cutteth off the water from the besieged: 19 The
  distress of the Bethulians: 23 They murmur
  against their governors, 30 who promise to give
  up the city, if not relieved within five days.

Chapter 8
1 Judith's family: her bahaviour in her widow-
  hood: 9 She sendeth for the governors of the
  city, blameth their rash promise, and adviseth
  them to trust in God: 28 They excuse them-
  selves, and intreat her prayers: 32 She promiseth
  to do something for them: 35 They bless her,
  and depart home.

Chapter 9
1 Judith humbleth herself, and prayeth God to
  prosper her purpose against the enemies of his
  sanctuary.

Chapter 10
1 Judith adorneth herself: 6 The governors
  marvel at her beauty, and with her success. 10
  She and her maid go forth unto the Assyrian
  camp, and are taken, and conducted to Holo-
  fernes' tent.

Chapter 11
1 Holofernes asketh Judith the cause of her coming:
  5 She telleth him by what means he may prevail,
  and promiseth to let him know the fit time: 20
  He is much taken with her wisdom and beauty.

Chapter 12
1 Judith excuseth herself from eating of Holofer-
  nes' meat. 5 She asketh leave to go forth to
  pray, and doeth so for three successive nights:
  10 On the fourth day Holofernes maketh a feast,
  and inviteth Judith: 15 She goeth to him, who
  for joy of her company drinketh largely.

Chapter 13
1 Judith left alone with Holofernes in the tent
  prayeth God to give her strength: 6 She cutteth
  off his head while he slept, and returneth with
  it to Bethulia: 12 The men of the city seeing
  it bless God and Judith.

Chapter 14
1 Judith adviseth how to give the alarm to the
  Assyrians: 5 she sendeth for Achior, who hear-
  ing and seeing what was done is circumcised.
  11 The head of Holofernes is hanged up, and
  the camp alarmed: 14 Holofernes is found
  dead, which causeth great lamantation.

Chapter 15
1 The Assyrians flee, are chased, and slain. 8
  The high priest and elders of Israel come to see
  Judith, and bless her. 11 All the stuff of
  Holofernes is given her. 12 The women at-
  tend her in the dance, and crown her and her
  maid with garlands.

Chapter 16
1 The song of Judith. 19 She dedicateth the
  stuff of Holofernes. 21 After a life of honour
  she dieth at Bethulia, and is lamented by all
  Israel seven days.

(Esther (Greek))

Chapter 10
Mardocheus remembereth and expoundeth his dream
  of the river and the two dragons.

Chapter 11
2 The stock and quality of Mardocheus: 6 he
  dreameth of two dragons coming forth to fight,
  and of a little fountain which became a great
  water.

Chapter 12
1 The conspiracy of the two eunuchs is discovered
  by Mardocheus, 5 for which he is entertained
  in the king's service, and rewarded. 6 Aman
  seeketh to molest him and the Jews.

Chapter 13
1 The copy of the king's letters to destroy the Jews:
  8 the prayer of Mardocheus for them.

Chapter 14
The prayer of the queen Esther for herself and
  her people.

Chapter 15
1 Esther cometh into the king's presence: 7 he
  looketh angrily, and she fainteth. 8 The king
  taketh her up, and comforteth her.

Chapter 16
1 The letter of Artaxerxes, wherein he setteth
  forth Aman's wicked designs, 17 revoketh the
  letters sent forth against the Jews, 22 and com-
  mandeth the day of their deliverance to be
  kept holy.

(Wisdom)

Chapter 1
1 An exhortation to love righteousness, and seek
  God. 4 Who they are with whom wisdom will
  not dwell. 6 An evil speaker cannot be hid.
  12 A caution not to procure our own destruction:
  13 God is not the author of death.

Chapter 2
1 The ungodly reasoning of the shortness of life,
  and Man's final extinction by death, 6 encourage
  themselves in sensuality, 10 and in oppressing
  the just. 21 What that is which blindeth them.

Chapter 3
1 The righteous are happy in their death, 4 and
  in the consequence of their afflictions. 10 The
  unhappiness of the wicked in their labours, and
  in their families. 13 The pure, though childless,
  are blessed. 16 The seed of the adulterer shall
  perish.

Chapter 4
1 Virtue is better than children. 3 Bastard slips
  shall not thrive, but shall witness against their
  parents. 7 The just, if he die young, is never-
  theless happy. 18 The contrary state of the wicked.

Chapter 5
1 The wicked amazed at the unexpected salva-
  tion of the righteous shall confess their error,
  and the vanity of their own lives. 15 The
  reward of the just from God; who will war
  against the wicked.

Chapter 6
1 Kings and rulers are admonished that they have
  their power from God, who will punish them
  severely for their abuse of it: 9 They are ex-
  horted to seek wisdom, which is easy to be found,
  and of especial use to princes.

Chapter 7
1 All men have their beginning and end alike.
  7 The author preferred wisdom before all things
  else. 15 God gave him all the knowledge he
  had. 22 The praise of wisdom.

Chapter 8
1 The valuable advantages of wisdom, 21 which
  coming from God only, the author addresseth
  himself to God in prayer.

Chapter 9
1 A prayer unto God for his wisdom, 6 without
  which the most perfect man will be nothing re-
  garded. 9 God by her made the world: 11
  she knoweth, but without her man knoweth
  not, how to please God.

Chapter 10
1 What wisdom did for Adam, 3 against Cain,
  4 for Noe, 5 Abraham, 6 Lot, and against
  the five cities, 10 for Jacob, 13 Joseph, 15
  the Israelites, and Moses.

Chapter 11
1 What wisdom did for the Israelities in the wil-
  derness, who were benefited by that whereby
  the Egyptians were punished; 15 and were
  afterward plagued by the things wherein they
  themselves had sinned. 17 God wanted not
  other means to have destroyed them: 23 but
  is merciful to all.

Chapter 12
1 God did not destroy the Canaanites at once; 9
  not for want of power, 12 for he is uncon-
  troulable; 19 but for the instruction of his
  own people. 23 They were punished with their
  false gods.

Chapter 13
1 They are vain and inexcusable who worship any
  of God's works as God; 10 but most wretched
  are they who worship the works of men's hands.

Chapter 14
1 Men about to sail pray to their idols, who are
  less able than their ships to save them. 8 Idols
  are accursed, and so are the makers of them.
  12 The beginning of idolatry, 22 and the effects
  of it. 30 God will punish those that swear
  falsely by idols.

Chapter 15
1 An acknowledgment of the true God. 6 The
  folly of the makers of idols, 14 and of the ene-
  mies of God's people: 15 because they worship-
  ped lifeless idols, 18 and vile beasts.

Chapter 16
1 God gave quails to his people to stir up their
  appetite, and vile beasts to their enemies to
  create a loathing: 5 The one were stung with
  serpents, but soon healed with mercy: the
  other killed by flies and grashoppers. 12 God's
  word hath power to save and to destroy. 16
  Strange plagues fell upon the ungodly. 17 The
  creatures altered their nature to favour God's
  people, and to offend their enemies.

Chapter 17
1 Why the Egyptians were punished with dark-
  ness. 4 The terrors of that darkness. 11 The
  terrors of an evil conscience.

Chapter 18
4 Why the Egyptians were punished with darkness,
  5 and with the death of their children. 18 They
  themselves saw the cause thereof. 20 God also
  plagued his own people. 21 By what means
  that plague was stayed.

Chapter 19
1 Why God shewed no mercy to the Egyptians, 5
  and how wonderfully he dealt with his people.
  14 The Egyptians were worse than the Sodo-
  mites. 18 The wonderful agreement of the
  creatures to serve God's people.

(Sirach)

Chapter 1
1 All wisdom is from God: 10 He giveth it to
  them that love him: 11 The fear of God is
  full of many blessings: 28 Against hypocrisy.

Chapter 2
1 God's servants must look for trouble, and with
  patience trust in him. 12 Woe to them that do
  not so. 15 The obedience and humility of such
  as fear God.

Chapter 3
1 Children must honour and help their parents.
  17 The blessings of meekness. 21 We must not
  be curious to know all things. 26 The evil of
  stubbornness. 30 The benefit of almsgiving
  and gratitude.

Chapter 4
1 The poor and fatherless are not to be despised.
  11 Wisdom is to be sought. 20 False shame is
  to be avoided, and the truth not to be gainsaid.
  29 Cautions against hasty speaking, ungoverned
  fury in our families, and sordidness.

Chapter 5
1 We must not presume upon our wealth and
  strength, nor let God's mercy tempt us to sin.
  8 Ill gotten goods will not profit. 9 Advice
  concerning the use of the tongue.

Chapter 6
1 Of constancy and sincerity in friendship. 2 A-
  gainst selfconceit. 4 The mischief of a wicked
  soul. 5 Concerning friends. 18 Wisdom is
  to be sought betimes, which though grievous
  to the foolish, yet is pleasant and honourable to
  those that have her. 32 We must be diligent
  to learn from wise men, 37 and attentive to
  God's law.

Chapter 7
1 Dissuasives against injustice, 4 ambition, 8 pre-
  sumption in sinning, 10 fainting in prayer, and
  neglect of almsgiving, 11 insult toward the poor,
  12 lying, 14 loquacity, 15 sloth. 16 Wrath
  will overtake the sinner. 18 How to act with
  respect to a friend, 19 a good woman, 20 an
  honest servant, 22 cattle, 23 children, 26 a
  good wife, 27 parents, 29 the Lord and his
  priests, 32 the poor and afflicted. 36 The end
  should be kept in mind.

Chapter 8
Lessons of prudence respecting our conduct toward
  others.

Chapter 9
1 How a man should behave toward his own
  wife, and other women. 10 An old friend is
  not to be forsaken. 11 The glory of sinners
  not to be envied or desired. 13 Against fami-
  liarity with men in power. 14 Our converse
  should be with wife and just men.

Chapter 10
1 The advantages of a wise ruler: 4 God setteth
  him up. 6 Against malice, pride, injustice,
  and covetousness. 19 The advantages of fear-
  ing the Lord. 25 Divers moral maxims.

Chapter 11
1 The benefit of wisdom. 2 We must not judge by
  outward appearances, 4 nor vaunt ourselves,
  7 nor blame or answer rashly, 9 nor strive offi-
  ciously, 10 nor be overmeddling. 11 Wealth
  and all other good things are from God: 21
  we should therefore labour, trusting in God. 28
  None to be judged blessed before death. 29 Ad-
  vice not to bring every man into our houses.

Chapter 12
1 In acts of liberality proper objects should be
  regarded. 8 Adversity is the test of true
  friendship. 10 An enemy and a wicked man
  are not to be trusted.

Chapter 13
1 We must not keep company with the proud, or
  with one mightier than ourselves. 15 Like lov-
  eth to consort with it's like. 21 The difference
  between the rich and the poor. 25 A man's heart
  will change his countenance.

Chapter 14
1 A good conscience maketh men happy. 13 The
  niggard doeth good neither to himself, nor to
  others. 11 Exhortations to do good while we
  can. 20 He is happy that draweth near to
  wisdom.

Chapter 15
1 The blessings of wisdom to him that feareth God.
  7 The wicked shall not obtain her. 9 Praise be-
  longeth not to sinners. 11 We must not charge
  God with our faults; 14 for he made us free
  to choose good or evil.

Chapter 16
1 It is better to have no children, than ungodly
  ones. 6 The wicked are not spared by God. 12
  Both the wrath of God and his mercy are great.
  17 None can be hid from him. 20 God's works
  are incomprehensible. 24 The praise of them.

Chapter 17
1 How God created and endowed man, 11 giving
  him knowledge, and a law against sin. 15 He
  seeth all the ways of man, and will recompense
  them. 24 The benefit of turning to him with
  repentance.

Chapter 18
1 God created and governeth all things. 4 His
  works are not to be told. 8 The shortness of
  man's life. 11 God is merciful. 15 Good deeds
  must not be blemished with ill words. 19 The
  benefit of timely precaution. 30 We must not
  follow our lusts.

Chapter 19
1 Sundry moral maxims. 7 We must not rehearse
  all that we hear. 13 Rules for the admoni-
  tion of friends. 18 The wisdom of fearing the
  Lord. 22 There is no wisdom in wickedness.
  29 A man may be known by his outward ap-
  pearance.

Chapter 20

  eth those in the tower at Jerusalem; they send
  to the king; 28 who bringeth a mighty army
  to their aid. 42 Judas fighteth with him.

  He thanketh the Father for revealing his Gospel
  to the simple only; 28 and inviteth the weary
  to partake of his rest.

Chapter 12
1 Christ alledgeth scripture in excuse of his disci-
  ples, whom the Pharisees charged with breaking
  the sabbath in plucking the ears of corn on the
  sabbath day. 9 He appealeth to reason, and
  healeth the withered hand on the sabbath day.
  14 The Pharisees seek to destroy him: a pro-
  phecy of Esaias fulfilled in him. 22 He healeth
  one possessed of a devil, who was blind and
  dumb; 24 and confuting the absurd charge of
  his casting out devils by Beelzebub, he sheweth
  that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is an un-
  pardonable sin, and that every idle word must
  be accounted for: 38 he rebuketh those that
  sought of him a sign, 46 and sheweth whom
  he regardeth as his nearest relations.

Chapter 13
1 The parable of the sower. 10 Why Christ
  taught in parables. 18 The exposition of the
  parable of the sower. 24 The parable of the
  tares; 31 of the grain of mustard seed; 33
  of the leaven. 36 The parable of the tares
  expounded. 44 The parable of the hidden trea-
  sure; 45 of one pearl of great price; 47 of
  a net cast into the sea. 53 Christ's countrymen
  are offended in him.

Chapter 14
1 Herod's opinion of Christ. 3 The cause and
  manner of John the Baptist's death. 13 Jesus
  departeth into a desert place, and feedeth there
  five thousand men with five loaves and two
  fishes. 22 He walketh on the sea to his disci-
  ples: 34 and landing at Gennesaret healeth the
  sick who touched but the hem of his garment.

Chapter 15
1 Christ reproveth the scribes and Pharisees for
  setting their own traditions above the command-
  ments of God. 10 He teacheth that not that
  which goeth into the mouth, but that which
  cometh out of it, defileth a man. 21 He healeth
  the daughter of a woman of Canaan; 29 and
  great multitudes near the sea of Galilee. 32
  He feedeth four thousand and upwards with
  seven loaves and a few small fishes.

Chapter 16
1 The Pharisees require a sign. 5 Jesus warneth
  his disciples against the leaven of the Pharisees
  and sadducees, and explaineth his meaning. 13
  The people's opinion, and Peter's confession, of
  Christ. 21 Jesus foresheweth his own death,
  and rebuketh Peter for dissuading him from it.
  24 He sheweth that his followers must deny
  themselves in prospect of a future reward.

Chapter 17
1 The transfiguration of Christ: 10 he instructeth
  his disciples concerning the coming of Elias: 14
  healeth the lunatick, 22 foretelleth his own pas-
  sion, 24 and payeth tribute.

Chapter 18
1 Christ proposeth a little child to his disciples
  for a pattern of innocence and humility; 7 he
  warneth them to avoid offences, though at the
  expence of an hand, a foot, or an eye: 10 and
  not to despise the little ones, whom it is the Fa-
  ther's will to save: 15 he teacheth how to
  treat an offending brother, 21 and how oft to
  forgive him, by the parable of a king, who
  punished one of his servants for refusing that
  mercy to his fellow, which he had experienced
  from his lord in a larger degree.

Chapter 19
1 Christ healeth the sick in Judea: 3 answereth
  the question of the Pharisees concerning divorce,
  and the objection of his disciples to the expediency
  of marriage: 13 receiveth little children with
  tenderness: 16 instructeth a young man how to
  attain eternal life, and how to become perfect:
  23 sheweth how hard it is for a rich man to
  enter into the kingdom of God: 27 and pro-
  miseth great rewards to his disciples, and to all
  who have forsaken ought to follow him.

Chapter 20
1 The parable of the labourers who were hired
  at different hours to work in the vineyard.
  17 Jesus foretelleth his own passion and resur-
  rection: 20 answereth the petition of the mother
  of Zebedee's children, and checketh the indig-
  nation of the other disciples thereat. 29 He
  giveth sight to two blind men.

Chapter 21
1 Christ rideth into Jerusalem upon an ass amidst
  the acclamations of the multitude. 12 He
  driveth the buyers and sellers out of the temple,
  and healeth the diseased there. 15 His reply
  to the priests and scribes who took offence at
  the Hosannahs of the people. 17 He curseth
  the barren fig tree, which presently withereth
  23 he silenceth the priests and elders who
  questioned his authority. 28 The parable of the
  two sons whom their father sent to work in his
  vineyard. 33 The parale of the vineyard let
  out to wicked husbandmen.

Chapter 22
1 The parable of the marriage of the king's son:
  the unworthiness of those that were first
  bidden: others called in their room: the
  punishment of one that came without a wed-
  ding garment. 15 The captious question pro-
  posed concerning paying tribute to Cefar,
  and Christ's answer. 23 He confuteth the
  Sadducees who questioned him touching the
  resurrection. 34 He sheweth which are the
  chief commandments of the law. 41 He pro-
  poseth to the Pharisees a knotty question con-
  cerning Christ.

Chapter 23
1 Christ exhorteth to observe the doctrine, but not
  to follow the evil examples, of the scribes and
  Pharisees; and particularly not to imitate their
  ambition: 13 he pronounceth divers woes against
  them for their blindness and hypocrisy: 34 and
  prophesieth the destruction of Jerusalem.

Chapter 24
1 Christ fortelleth the destruction of the temple:
  3 he sheweth what signs and calamities shall
  go before it; and what shall happen at the
  time of his coming. 32 By a parable of the
  fig tree he marketh the certainty of the predic-
  tion. 36 No man knoweth the day and hour,
  which shall come suddenly. 42 We ought there-
  fore to watch, like good servants who expect
  their master's coming.

Chapter 25
1 The parable of the ten virgins; 14 and of the
  talents, which a king distributed among his ser-
  vants, to be improved by them. 31 A descrip-
  tion of the last judgment.

Chapter 26
1 Christ again foretelleth his own death. 3 The
  rulers conspire against him. 6 A woman pour-
  eth precious ointment upon his head. 14 Judas
  bargaineth to betray him. 17 Christ eateth the
  passover, and pointeth out the traitor: 26 he
  instituteth his last supper: 30 foretelleth the
  desertion of his disciples, and Peter's denial of
  him. 36 His agony and prayer in the garden.
  47 He is betrayed and apprehended. 51 One
  of the servants of the high priest hath his ear
  cut off; Jesus forbiddeth opposition: 57 he is
  carried to Caiaphas, falsely accused, examined,
  pronounced guilty, and treated with indignity.
  69 Peter's denial and repentence.

Chapter 27
1 Christ is delivered bound to Pilate. 3 Judas
  hangeth himself. 11 Christ's silence before Pi-
  late. 15 Pilate's custom at the feast, and pro-
  posal to the people: 19 his wife's message:
  20 being urged by the multitude, he washeth his
  hands in his own justification, and releasing
  Barabbas delivereth Jesus to be crucified.
  27 Christ is mocked of the soldiers, crowned
  with thorns, 33 crucified between two thieves,
  39 reviled, 45 and calling upon God expireth.
  51 The astonishing events which attended his
  death: the centurion's confession. 57 Joseph
  of Arimathea beggeth his body, and burieth
  it. 62 His sepulchre is sealed, and a watch
  set over it.

Chapter 28
1 Christ's resurrection is declared by an angel to
  the women. 9 Christ himself appeareth to them.
  11 The chief priests bribe the soldiers to report
  that he was stolen by the disciples. 16 Christ
  appeareth to the eleven in Galilee; 18 and
  sendeth them to teach and baptize all nations.

(Mark)

Chapter 1
1 The gospel beginneth with the preaching of John
  the Baptist. 9 Jesus is baptized, witnessed
  to from heaven; 12 and tempted of the devil:
  14 preacheth in Galilee; 16 calleth Peter,
  Andrew, James, and John: 23 healeth one
  possessed of an unclean spirit, 29 Simon's mo-
  ther in law, 32 and divers other diseased per-
  sons: 35 prayeth alone, and goeth on to preach:
  40 cleanseth a leper.

Chapter 2
1 Christ, followed by multitudes, 3 healeth one sick
  of the palsy: 13 calleth Matthew from the
  receipt of custom: 15 justifieth himself for eat-
  ing with publicans and sinners: 18 excuseth
  his disciples for not fasting: 23 and vindi-
  cateth them for plucking the ears of corn on
  the sabbath day.

Chapter 3
1 Christ appealing to reason healeth the withered
  hand on the sabbath day. 6 The Pharisees
  conspire his death: he retireth to the sea side,
  and healeth many: 13 he chooseth his twelve
  apostles: 20 his friends look upon him as beside
  himself: 22 he confuteth the blasphemous ab-
  surdity of the Pharisees in ascribing his casting
  out of devils to the power of  Beelzebub. 31
  Those who do the will of God he regardeth as
  his nearest relations.

Chapter 4
1 The parable of the sower. 10 Why Christ
  taught in parables. 14 The exposition of the
  parable. 21 The light of knowledge is given
  to be communicated to others. 26 The king-
  dom of God likened to the seed which groweth
  imperceptibly: 30 and to a grain of mustard
  seed. 35 Christ stilleth a tempest by his word.

Chapter 5
1 Christ casteth out the legion of devils, and suf-
  fereth them to enter into the herd of swine:
  21 he is intreated by Jairus to go and heal his
  daughter: 25 by the way he healeth a  woman
  of an inveterate issue of blood: 35 he raiseth
  Jairus' daughter to life.

Chapter 6
1 Christ is slighted by his own countrymen: 7 he
  sendeth out the twelve with power over unclean
  spirits. 14 The opinions of Herod and others
  concerning him. 16 John the Baptist impri-
  soned and beheaded by Herod at the instigation
  of Herodias. 30 The apostles return from their
  mission. 34 The miracle of five thousand fed
  with five loaves and two fishes. 45 Christ
  walketh on the sea to his disciples; 53 he
  landeth at Gennesaret, and healeth the sick who
  but touched the hem of his garment.

Chapter 7
1 The Pharisees finding fault with his disciples
  for eating with unwashen hands, Christ re-
  proveth them of hypocrisy, and of making void
  the commandments of God by the traditions of
  men: 14 he teacheth that a man is defiled, not
  by that which entereth in, but by that which
  cometh out of him: 24 he healeth the daugh-
  ter of a Syro-phenician woman; 31 and a man
  that was deaf and had an impediment in his
  speech.

Chapter 8
1 Christ miraculously feedeth four thousand persons:
  10 he refuseth the Pharisees a sign: 14 he warn-
  eth his disciples against the leaven of the Pha-
  risees and of Herod, and explaineth his meaning:
  22 he giveth a blind man sight. 27 The people's
  opinions, and Peter's confession, of him: 31 he
  foresheweth his own death, and rebuketh Peter
  for dissuading him from it: 34 he sheweth his
  followers that they must deny themselves, and
  not be ashamed of him and his gospel.

Chapter 9
1 The transfiguration of Christ: 11 he instruct-
  eth his disciples concerning the coming of Elias:
  14 he casteth out a dumb and deaf spirit: 30 he
  foretelleth his own death and resurrection; 33
  checketh the ambition of his discoples; 38 bid-
  ding them to hinder no one from working miracles
  in his name, and warning them to avoid offences.

Chapter 10
1 Christ teacheth in Judea: 2 answereth the
  Pharisees' question concerning divorce: 13 bless-
  eth the children that were brought unto him:
  17 instructeth a rich man how to attain eternal
  life: 23 sheweth how hard it is for the rich to
  enter into the kingdom of God: 28 promiseth
  rewards to all who have forsaken ought for his
  gospel's sake: 32 foretelleth his own death and
  resurrection: 35 putteth by the ambitious suit
  of the sons of Zebedee; and checketh the indig-
  nation of the other disciples thereat: 46 giveth
  sight to blind Bartimeus.

Chapter 11
1 Christ rideth into Jerusalem in triumph: 12
  curseth a barren fig tree: 15 driveth the
  buyers and sellers out of the temple. 20 The
  cursed fig tree is dried up: Christ exhorteth to
  faith in prayer, and to forgiveness of enemies:
  27 and silenceth the priests and others, who
  called in question his authority.

Chapter 12
1 In the parable of the vineyard let out to wicked
  husbandmen Christ foretelleth the reprobation of
  the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles: 13
  his reply to the insidious question concerning
  paying tribute to Cesar: 18 he confuteth the
  Sadducees who questioned him concerning the
  resurrection: 28 he sheweth which are the
  two great commandments of the law: 35 he
  proposeth a difficulty to the scribes concerning
  the character of Christ: 38 he cautioneth the
  people against their ambition and hypocrisy; 41
  and valueth the poor widow's two mites above
  all the gifts of the rich.

Chapter 13
1 Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple;
  3 sheweth what signs and calamities should go
  before, 24 and what should happen at the time
  of his coming: 32 No man knoweth the day or
  hour; we must therefore watch and pray, that
  we may not be found unprepared.

Chapter 14
1 The chief priests and scribes conspire against
  Christ. 3 A woman poureth precious ointment
  on his head. 10 Judas covenanteth to betray
  him. 12 Christ eateth the passover, and shew-
  eth that one of his disciples should betray him:
  22 he instituteth his last supper: 26 fortelleth
  the desertion of all his disciples, and Peter's
  denial of him: 32 his agony and prayer in the
  garden. 43 He is betrayed by Judas, and ap-
  prehended: his disciples flee: 53 he is carried
  before the council, falsely accused, examined,
  pronounced guilty, and treated with indignity.
  66 Peter's denial, and repentance.

Chapter 15
1 Jesus is brought bound and accused before Pi-
  late: his silence before the governor. 6 Pilate,
  prevailed upon by the clamours of the people,
  releaseth Barabbas, and giveth up Jesus to be
  crucified. 16 Christ is mocked of the soldiers,
  crowned with thorns, and led to the place of
  crucifixion: 24 he is crucified between two
  thieves, 29 reviled, 33 and calling upon God
  expireth. 38 The veil of the temple rent.
  39 The centurion's confession. 42 Joseph of
  Arimathea beggeth the body, and burieth it.

Chapter 16
1 Christ's resurrection is declared by angels to the
  two Maries and Salome. 9 Christ himself ap-
  peareth to Mary Magdalene; 12 to two of his
  disciples going into the country; 14 and to
  the eleven; whom he commissioneth to preach
  the gospel to all the world: 19 his ascension
  into heaven; the gospel is preached every where,
  the Lord confirming the word with signs.

(Luke)

Chapter 1
1 Luke's preface. 5 An angel appeareth to
  Zacharias, and promiseth him a son in his old
  age: 18 Zacharias doubting is struck dumb
  for a sign: 24 his wife Elisabeth conceiveth.
  26 The angel's visit to Mary. 39 Elisabeth
  saluted by Mary prophesieth. 46 Mary's song
  of thanksgiving. 57 The birth and circumci-
  sion of John the Baptist. 64 Zacharias'
  mouth is opened: 67 his prophecy.

  thereof to the shepherds: the heavenly host
  praise God. 15 The shepherds, finding it to be
  as the angel had said, glorify God. 21 The
  circumcision of Christ. 22 The purifying of
  Mary. 25 Simeon's prophecy, 36 and Anna's,
  concerning Christ. 39 Jesus groweth, and in-
  creaseth in wisdom. 41 At twelve years of age
  he goeth with his parents to Jerusalem, and
  questioneth with the doctors in the temple: 51
  he is obedient to his parents.

Chapter 3
1 The preaching and baptism of John: 15 his
  testimony of Christ: 19 Herod imprisoneth
  John for his free reproof. 21 Christ is bap-
  tized, and receiveth testimony from heaven.
  23 The age and genealogy of Christ from Jo-
  seph upwards.

Chapter 4
1 Christ fasteth forty days, and is tempted of the de-
  vil. 14 He beginneth to preach: 16 The people
  of Nazareth wonder at his gracious words,
  but being offended go about to kill him: he
  escapeth by miracle. 33 He casteth out a devil:
  38 healeth Simon's mother in law, 40 and many
  other diseased persons: 41 the devils acknow-
  ledging him are silenced: 42 he preacheth through
  the cities of Galilee.

Chapter 5
1 Christ teacheth the people out of Simon's ship.
  4 The miraculous draught of fishes: Simon and
  the two sons of Zebedee follow him. 12 Christ
  cleanseth a leper; 16 prayeth in the wilder-
  ness: 17 answereth the reasonings of the scribes
  and Pharisees concerning his forgiving sins, and
  healeth the sick of the palsy: 27 calleth Levi
  from the receipt of custom: 29 justifieth his
  eating with publicans and sinners: 33 excuseth
  his disciples from fasting for the present; 36
  and illustrateth the matter by a twofold parable.

Chapter 6
1 Christ alledgeth scripture in defence of his dis-
  ciples plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath
  day: 6 he appealeth to reason, and healeth the
  withered hand on the sabbath. 12 He spend-
  eth the night in prayer, and chooseth the twelve
  apostles: 17 he healeth divers diseased: 20
  pronounceth blessings and woes: 27 teacheth to
  return good for evil, and other lessons of moral
  duty: 46 and admonisheth to be his disciples
  in practice, and not in profession only.

Chapter 7
1 Christ admireth the centurion's singular faith,
  and healeth his absent servant: 11 he raiseth
  to life the widow's son at Nain: 18 and sendeth
  back the messengers of John with an account of
  the miracles they had seen wrought by him:
  24 his testimony of John: 31 he reproveth the
  perverseness of the people, who were not to be
  won either by the manners of John or himself:
  36 he suffereth his feet to be washed and
  anointed by a woman who had been a sinner;
  and in a parable sheweth that even the worst
  of sinners may be forgiven upon the terms of
  a hearty and sincere repentance.

1 Christ preacheth through the cities, attended by
  his disciples, and ministered unto by devout
  women of their substance. 4 The parable of
  the sower. 9 Why Christ taught in parables.
  11 The parable expounded. 16 Light is given
  to be improved and communicated. 19 Christ
  sheweth whom he regardeth as his nearest rela-
  tions: 22 stilleth a tempest on the sea with
  his word: 26 casteth out the legion of devils,
  and suffereth them to enter into the herd of
  swine: is intreated by the Gadarenes to
  depart, and refuseth the attendance of him
  whom he had healed: 41 is besought by Jairus

  he healeth a woman of an inveterate issue of
  blood: 49 he raiseth Jairus' daughter to life.

Chapter 9
1 Christ sendeth his apostles to work miracles and
  preach the gospel. 7 Herod desireth to see him.
  10 The apostles return: 12 Christ feedeth five
  thousand men with five loaves and two fishes.
  18 The different opinions concerning Christ;
  Peter's confession of him: Christ fortelleth
  his own death and resurrection: 23 he sheweth
  his followers the necessity of self denial, and that
  they must not be ashamed of own his gospel:
  28 he is transfigured: 37 healeth a demoniac:
  43 again foresheweth his sufferings: 46 check-
  eth the ambitious disputes of his disciples: 49
  will not have them forbid any one to work mi-
  racles in his name: 51 reproveth the fiery zeal
  of James and John against the Samaritans who
  would not receive him: 57 and proposeth terms
  to three persons who offer to follow him.

Chapter 10
1 Christ sendeth out the seventy disciples to work
  miracles and to preach: 13 he pronounceth a
  woe against Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Caper-
  naum. 17 the seventy return with joy; Christ
  sheweth them wherein to rejoice: 21 he thank-
  eth his father for having revealed his gospel to
  the simple only: 23 he sheweth the blessedness
  of those that were called into his church: 25
  he teacheth a lawyer how to attain eternal life;
  and by the parable of the good Samaritan shew-
  eth whom we are to consider as our neighbour:
  38 he commendeth Mary's attention to his
  doctrine in preference to Martha's busy care to
  entertain him.

Chapter 11
1 Christ teacheth to pray, assuring that God will
  give all good things to them that ask him: 14
  he casteth out a devil, and reproveth the blas-
  phemy of the Pharisees, who ascribed the mi-
  racle to the power of Beelzebub: 27 he sheweth
  who are the truly blessed; 29 and the inexcuse-
  ableness of not believing his gospel; 37 he re-
  prehendeth the outward shew of holiness in the
  Pharisees, and pronounceth woes against them
  and the scribes and lawyers.

Chapter 12
1 Christ teacheth his disciples to avoid hypocrisy,
  and not to be fearful in publishing his doctrine:
  13 he refuseth to be judge in a civil cause, and
  warneth the people to beware of covetousness by
  the parable of a rich man, who boasted himself
  in his multiplied stores: 22 he exhorteth not to
  be over anxious about the provisions of this life;
  but to seek the kingdom of God; 33 to lay up
  treasure in heaven by giving alms; 35 and to be
  always ready against our Lord's coming 41 By
  the parable of a good and a wicked steward
  he sheweth the duty of his ministers in particular:
  49 he foretelleth the divisions on account of the
  gospel: 54 reproveth the people for not discern-
  ing the times: 57 and sheweth the danger of
  neglecting the means of reconciliation offered
  them.

Chapter 13
1 Christ sheweth that temporal calamities are no
  sure signs of sinfulness, but that others should
  take warning by them, and repent. 6 The parable
  of the fig tree that was ordered to be cut down for
  being fruitless. 10 Christ healeth a woman
  that had been long bowed together, and putteth
  the hypocritical ruler of the synagogue to silence:
  18 he likeneth the progress of the gospel to a
  grain of mustard seed; 20 and to leaven: 23
  being asked of the number of the saved, he ex-
  horteth to strive to enter in at the strait gate:
  31 he will not be diverted from his course
  through fear of Herod; and lamenteth over the
  approaching desolation of Jerusalem.

Chapter 14
1 Christ healeth the dropsy on the sabbath, and
  justifieth his doing so: 7 he recommendeth humi-
  lity; 12 and hospitality toward the poor. 15
  The parable of the marriage supper, and of the
  guests, who making excuses were excluded, and
  their rooms filled by others: 25 he adviseth those
  who are willing to be his disciples to examine be-
  forehand their resolution in case of persecutions.
  34 The unprofitableness of salt, when it hath
  lost its savour.

Chapter 15

  sinners. 3 The parable of the lost sheep, 8 and
  piece of silver; 11 and of the prodigal son.

  were covetous, and derided him. 19 The parable
  of the rich man and Lazarus the beggar.

Chapter 17
1 Christ teacheth to avoid giving occasions of of-
  fence: 3 and to forgive one another. 5 The
  power of faith, and defect of merit toward
  God in our best services. 11 Christ healeth ten
  lepers: 20 sheweth the spiritual nature of the
  kingdom of God; 22 and instructeth his disci-
  ples concerning the coming of the Son of man.

Chapter 18
1 The parable of the unjust judge and the impor-
  tunate widow. 9 The parable of the Phari-
  see and publican. 15 Christ's tenderness to the
  little children that were brought unto him. 18

  24 he sheweth how hard it is for the rich to
  enter into the kingdom of God: 28 promiseth
  rewards to those who have foregone ought for
  the gospel's sake: 31 foretelleth his own death
  and resurrection: 35 and giveth sight to a
  blind man.

Chapter 19
1 Christ visiteth Zaccheus the publican. 11 The
  parable of a nobleman who left money with his
  servants to trade with in his absence. 28
  Christ rideth in triumph into Jerusalem: 41
  he weepeth over the city: 45 driveth the buy-
  ers and sellers out of the temple: 47 teacheth
  daily therein: the rulers seek to destroy him.

Chapter 20
1 Christ silenceth those who questioned his autho-
  rity. 9 The parable of the vineyard let out
  to wicked husbandmen. 19 The chief priests
  and scribes seek matter against him: his re-
  ply to their insidious question concerning pay-
  ing tribute to Cesar. 27 He confuteth the
  Sadducees concerning the resurrection: 41 he
  propoundeth a difficulty concerning the character
  of Christ: 45 he warneth his disciples against
  the ambition and hypocrisy of the scribes.

Chapter 21
1 Christ valueth the poor widow's two mites above
  all the larger offerings of the rich: 5 foretel-
  leth the destruction of the temple; 7 the signs
  and calamities that should precede and accom-
  pany it; 25 and what should happen at the
  time of the son of man's coming: 34 he ex-
  horteth to watchfulness and prayer.

Chapter 22
1 The chief priests and scribes conspire against
  Christ: 3 Judas covenanteth to betray him.
  7 The apostles sent to prepare the passover:
  Christ eateth it with them; 19 and instituteth
  his last supper: 21 he covertly pointeth out the
  traitor: 24 checketh the ambitious strife of his
  disciples, and promiseth them a share in his
  kingdom: 31 he telleth Peter of Satan's desire
  to sift him; but that his faith should be sup-
  ported; and yet he should thrice deny him: 35
  he adviseth his disciples to provide necessaries
  and a sword: 39 his agony and prayer in the
  garden: 47 he is betrayed; 50 healeth a
  servant of the high priest, whose ear was
  cut off; 54 is led to the high priest's house;
  Peter thrice denieth him. 63 Christ is scorn-
  fully used; 66 and brought before the council,
  where confessing himself to be the son of God,
  he is pronounced guilty of blasphemy.

Chapter 23
1 Jesus is accused before Pilate, who sendeth him
  to Herod. 8 Herod disappointed in his ex-
  pectations mocketh him, and sendeth him back.
  12 Herod and Pilate are made friends. 13
  Pilate, willing to release Jesus, is prevailed
  on by the clamours of the people to release Ba-
  rabbas and give Jesus to be crucified. 26 Being
  led to the place of execution, Jesus biddeth the
  women who lamented him to weep rather for
  themselves and their children: 32 he is crucified
  between two malefactors: 34 prayeth for his
  enemies; 35 is scoffed at; 39 reviled by one
  of the malefactors, but confessed by the other, to
  whom he promiseth a place in paradise. 44
  The unusual darkness, and rending of the veil
  of the temple: 46 Christ crieth unto God, and
  expireth: 47 the centurion's confession of him.
  50 Jeseph of Arimathea beggeth his body, and
  burieth it. 55 The women prepare spices
  against the end of the sabbath.

Chapter 24
1 Christ's resurrection is declared by two angels to
  the women that came to the sepulchre, who re-
  port it to others, but are not believed. 12 Peter
  visiteth the sepulchre. 13 Christ appeareth to
  two disciples going to Emmaus; 36 and to the
  apostles, eating before them, and explaining the
  scriptures concerning himself: 49 he promiseth
  them the Holy Ghost, 50 and ascendeth into
  heaven.

(John)

Chapter 1
1 The divinity of Christ. 6 The mission of John,
  and end of Christ's coming. 14 The incarnation
  of the Word. 15 Christ's superior dignity wit-
  nessed by John, and evinced by his gracious dis-
  pensation. 19 John's record of himself to the
  messengers of the Jews: 29 His public testimony
  to the person of Christ: 35 Two of his disciples
  hearing it follow Jesus: Simon is brought to
  Christ, and surnamed Cephas. 43 Philip is call-
  ed, who bringeth Nathanael to Jesus.

Chapter 2
1 Christ turneth water into wine in Cana of Ga-
  lilee: 12 he goeth to Capernaum; 13 thence to
  Jerusalem, where he driveth the buyers and
  sellers out  of the temple: 18 he giveth his own
  death and resurrection for a sign: 23 Many
  believe in him because of his miracles, but he
  would not trust himself unto them.

Chapter 3
1 Christ in a conference with Nicodemus teacheth
  him the necessity of regeneration; 14 the effi-
  cacy of faith in his death; 16 God's great love to
  mankind in sending his son for their salvation;
  18 and the condemnation for unbelief. 22 Jesus
  baptizeth in Judea, 23 as doth John in Ænon.
  25 John's doctrine concerning Christ.

Chapter 4
1 Christ talketh with a woman of Samaria, and
  revealeth himself unto her: 27 his disciples
  marvel; the woman calleth the men of her
  city to see him: 31 Christ sheweth his own zeal
  to do God's work, and the blessedness of his
  disciples, who were to reap the fruit of his
  labours. 39 Many Samaritans believe on
  him. 43 He goeth into Galilee, and healeth a
  nobleman's son who lay sick at Capernaum.

Chapter 5
1 Christ cureth an impotent man at the pool of
  Bethesda on the sabbath day: 10 the Jews ca-
  vil, and persecute him for it; 17 he justifieth
  himself by the example of God his Father: 19
  and asserteth the power and judgment committed
  unto him by the Father: 31 he appealeth to the
  testimony of John, 36 of the Father, 39 and of
  the scriptures: 41 he sheweth that his humility
  caused their rejection of him; 45 but that in
  disbelieving him they disbelieved Moses also.

Chapter 6
1 Christ feedeth five thousand men with five
  loaves and two fishes: 15 he withdraweth
  himself from the people, who would have made
  him a king, and walketh on the sea: 22 the
  multitude flocking to him, he reproveth their
  carnal views, and requireth their faith in him
  whom God had sent. 30 They ask a sign like
  that of the manna in the wilderness; he de-
  clareth himself to be the bread of life from
  heaven, and that none can live but by eating
  his flesh and drinking his blood. 60 Many of
  his disciples taking offence thereat, he sheweth
  his meaning to be spiritual. 66 Many leaving
  him, Peter in the name of the twelve professeth
  stedfast faith in him; Jesus pronounceth one of
  them to be a devil.

Chapter 7
1 Jesus, exhorted by his unbelieving kinsmen to
  shew himself at Jerusalem at the feast of taber-
  nacles, refuseth, but afterward goeth up in se-
  cret. 11 The Jews seek him, and differ in
  their sentiments of him. 14 He teacheth in the
  temple; 30 some are ready to lay hands on him,
  others believe; the rulers send officers to appre-
  hend him. 33 Christ foretelleth his departure
  to the Father, and promiseth the Holy Spirit to
  believers. 40 Divers opinions concerning him.
  45 The officers struck with his discourse return
  without him, and are rebuked by the Pharisees,
  who chide with Nicodemus for taking his part.

Chapter 8
1 Christ letteth go uncondemned the woman taken
  in adultery: 12 he declareth himself to be the
  light of the world, and justifieth his doctrine
  against the Pharisees: 31 he promiseth freedom
  through knowledge of the truth to those Jews
  who believed on him: 33 confuteth their vain
  boast of being Abraham's seed, and the children
  of God: 48 answereth their reviling by shewing
  his authority and dignity; 59 and by miracle
  rescueth himself from their attempts to stone him.

Chapter 9
1 A man that was born blind receiveth sight: 8 he
  relateth to his neighbors the means of his cure:
  13 he is brought to the Pharisees, who examine
  strictly into the fact, and are offended with his
  acknowledgment of the divine mission of the
  author: 34 they excommunicate him: 35 he is
  received of Jesus, and confesseth him: 39
  Christ taxeth the Pharisees with spiritual
  blindness.

Chapter 10
1 Christ declareth himself to be the door, and the
  good shepherd. 19 Divers opinions concerning
  him. 22 He proveth to the Jews by his works
  that he is the Christ, and asserteth his unity
  with the Father. 31 The Jews go about to
  stone him; he justifieth his doctrine; 39 and
  escaping from them goeth beyond Jordan, where
  many believe on him.

Chapter 11
1 The sickness and death of Lazarus: Jesus rais-
  eth him to life after he had been dead four days:
  many Jews believe. 47 The Pharisees hold a
  council against Christ: Caiaphas prophesieth:
  Jesus retireth from places of publick resort.
  55 At the approach of the passover the Jews
  enquire about him: the rulers give orders to
  apprehend him.

Chapter 12
1 Mary anointeth the feet of Jesus: Judas mur-
  mureth at the cost. 9 The people flock to see
  Lazarus: the chief priests consult to kill him.
  12 Jesus rideth into Jerusalem in triumph.
  20 Certain Greeks desire to see him. 23 He
  sheweth the benefit of his death to believers;
  prayeth to his Father; is answered by a voice
  from heaven; signifieth the manner of his death;
  and exhorteth to make good use of the present
  light. 37 the generality of the Jews believe
  not: 42 yet many chief rulers believe, but
  dare not confess him: 44 he urgeth faith in
  his divine mission.

Chapter 13
1 Jesus washeth his disciples' feet, and exhorteth
  them to follow his example of humility and cha-
  rity: 18 he fortelleth the treachery of Judas,
  and pointeth him out to John by a token: 31
  he speaketh of his glorification as near at hand,
  and commandeth his disciples to love one another:
  36 he forewarneth Peter that he shall thrice
  deny him.

Chapter 14
1 Christ comforteth his disciples with the promise
  of a heavenly mansion: 5 he professeth himself
  the way, the truth, and the life; 8 and that
  he is one with the Father: 12 he promiseth them
  power to do greater works than his own, and
  the grant of all that they should ask in his name:
  15 he requireth their obedience as a proof of
  their love, and giveth them a promise of the
  Comforter, the Holy Ghost: 27 he leaveth his
  peace with them.

Chapter 15
1 Under the parable of a vine Christ setteth forth
  God's government of his church, and exhorteth
  his disciples to abide in his faith and doctrine:
  12 he commandeth them to love one another,
  according to the great love he had shewed for
  them: 18 he forewarneth them of the hatred and
  persecution of the world: 26 and telleth them
  of the testimony which the Holy Ghost, and they
  also, should bear to him.

Chapter 16
1 Christ warneth his disciples of their sufferings
  for his sake: 5 he comforteth them by a pro-
  mise of the Holy Ghost: 16 he intimateth his
  death, resurrection, and ascension, telling them
  that their sorrow should soon be succeeded by
  joy, and that their prayers in his name would
  be accepted of the Father: 29 his disciples
  confess their faith in him; he foretelleth their
  desertion of him, and promiseth them peace in
  him amidst their tribulation in the world.

Chapter 17
1 Christ prayeth to his Father to glorify him;
  6 and to preserve his apostles in unity of faith,
  15 and from all evil; 17 and to sanctify them
  with the word of truth: 20 and for the per-
  fect union of all believers, and their admission
  to a share of his glory in heaven.

Chapter 18
1 Judas betrayeth Jesus: the officers and soldiers
  at Christ's word fall to the ground: 10 Peter
  cutteth off Malchus' ear: 12 Jesus is led
  bound to Annas and Caiaphas: 15 Peter de-
  nieth him: 19 Jesus is examined by the high
  priest, and struck by one of the officers: 25
  Peter denieth him the second and third time: 28
  Jesus brought before Pilate, and examined,
  confesseth his kingdom not to be of this world:
  Pilate testifying his innocence, and offering to
  release him, the Jews prefer Barabbas.

Chapter 19
1 Jesus is scourged, crowned with thorns, mocked,
  and buffeted by the soldiers. 4 Pilate declareth
  his innocence: the Jews charge him with as-
  suming the title of the Son of God. 8 Pilate
  upon farther examination is more desirous to
  release him, but overcome with the clamours
  of the Jews delivereth him to be crucified.
  17 He is led to Golgotha, and crucified between
  two malefactors. 19 Pilate's inscription on his
  cross. 23 The soldiers part his garments.
  25 He commendeth his mother to John; 28
  receiveth vinegar to drink, and dieth. 31 The
  legs of the others are broken, and the side of
  Jesus pierced. 38 Joseph of Arimathea beggeth
  his body, and assisted by Nicodemus burieth it.

Chapter 20
1 Mary Magdalene, seeing the stone taken away
  from the sepulchre, runneth to tell Peter and
  John, who go thither, and find not the
  body. 11 Mary seeth two angels sitting in the
  sepulchre; Jesus himself appearerh to her. 19
  He appeareth to his disciples: 24 The incre-
  dulity of Thomas. 26 Jesus appeareth again
  to the disciples, and satisfieth the doubts of
  Thomas; who confesseth him. 30 The suffi-
  ciency of what is written for a ground of faith
  unto salvation.

Chapter 21
1 Christ appeareth to his disciples at the sea of
  Tiberias, and maketh himself known by a great
  draught of fishes: 12 he eateth before them:
  15 he thrice repeateth his charge to Peter to
  feed his flock; foretelleth the manner of his
  death; and rebuketh his curiosity concerning
  John. 24 John asserteth the truth of his tes-
  timony, and that Jesus did many acts besides,
  too numerous to be recorded.

(Acts)

Chapter 1
1 Christ after his resurrection, having given in-
  structions to his apostles, and commanded them
  to wait in Jerusalem the coming of the Holy
  Ghost, ascendeth into heaven in their sight.
  10 Two angels warn them to depart, and to
  look for his second coming: 12 they return, and
  give themselves unto prayer. 15 Peter exhort-
  ing to fill up the place of the traitor Judas,
  Matthias is chosen by lot to be an apostle.

Chapter 2
1 The descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles
  on the day of Pentecost: they speak divers lan-
  guages to the general amazement, but some de-
  ride them. 14 Peter sheweth that the inspi-
  ration spoken of by Joel was now fulfilled;
  that Jesus, whom they had crucified, was now
  risen from the dead, and ascended into heaven,
  according to David's predictions, and had shed
  forth the promise of the holy Spirit in full
  proof of his being the Messias. 37 A great
  number are converted by Peter's preaching; 41
  who, being baptized, converse devoutly and cha-
  ritably together, the apostles working many mi-
  racles, and God daily increasing the church.

Chapter 3
1 The lame man healed by Peter and John: 12
  Peter declareth to the people that this cure was
  not wrought by any power or holiness in himself
  or John, but by the power of God through faith
  in the name of Jesus, whom they had ignorantly
  crucified, but whom God had raised from the
  dead according to the scriptures; and exhort-
  eth them by faith to seek remission of sins and
  salvation in Jesus, whose coming had been spoken
  of by Moses and all the prophets.

Chapter 4
1 The rulers of the Jews, offended with the teach-
   ing of Peter and John, imprison them. 5 Being
   brought before the council, Peter boldly avouch-
   eth the late cure to have been wrought in the
   name of Jesus, and that men can be saved by
   no other name. 13 The council, struck with the
   boldness of the two apostles, after conferring to-
   gether dismiss them with a threatening charge
   to speak no more in the name of Jesus. 23 The
   church betaketh itself to prayer. 31 The pre-
   sence of the Holy Ghost is signified by the house
   shaking, and the Apostles thereby emboldened to
   speak the word; 32 The unity and charity of
   the church, who have their possessions in common.

Chapter 5
1 Ananias and Sapphira, profanely tempting the
  Holy Ghost with a lie, at Peter's rebuke fall
  down dead. 12 The apostles work many miracles
  to the great increase of the faith. 17 They are
  all imprisoned, but released by an angel, and sent
  to preach openly in the temple: being brought
  before the council, 29 they support their wit-
  ness with great freedom. 33 The council are re-
  strained from killing them by the advice of Ga-
  maliel, but beat and dismiss them with a
  charge not to speak in the name of Jesus. 41
  They rejoice in their sufferings, and cease not to
  preach Christ both in publick and private.

Chapter 6
1 The apostles, that the poor might not be
  neglected, recommend, 5 and with the church's
  consent ordain seven chosen men deacons. 7 The
  word of God prevaileth. 8 Stephen, full of
  faith and the Holy Ghost, confuting those with
  whom he disputed, is brought before the council,
  and by suborned evidence falsely accused of blas-
  phemy against the law and the temple.

Chapter 7
1 Stephen, called upon to answer the charge against
  him, relateth how God called Abraham, and
  gave him and his seed the land of Canaan by
  promise; 9 how Joseph was sold by his brethren,
  and Jacob with his family went down into Egypt;
  17 how, when they were oppressed by the Egyp-
  tians, Moses was born, and sent to deliver Israel
  out of Egypt; 37 that this same Moses wit-
  nessed of Christ, received the law, and experi-
  enced the disobedience and idolatry of their fore-
  fathers; 44 who had the tabernacle of witness,
  till Solomon built the temple; 51 he reproacheth
  his hearers with imitating their father's rebel-
  lion against God, and persecution of his pro-
  phets, by having themselves murdered Christ,
  and transgressed the law they had received. 54
  Stung with the reproach, they stone him, looking
  up with faith unto God, and calling upon Jesus
  to receive his soul, and forgive his persecutors.

Chapter 8
1 The disciples being dispersed by reason of a
  great persecution at Jerusalem, a church is
  planted by Philip in Samaria; 9 Simon the
  sorcerer is baptized with many others. 14 Pe-
  ter and John are sent thither, who by prayer
  and imposition of hands give the Holy Ghost.
  18 Simon offereth money for the like power,
  is sharply reproved by Peter for his wickedness
  and hypocrisy, and admonished to repent: the
  apostles return to Jerusalem, having preached
  the word. 26 Philip is sent by an angel to
  convert and baptize an Ethiopian eunuch.

Chapter 9
1 Saul going toward Damascus is encompassed
  with a light from heaven, falleth to the earth,
  is called by Christ, and led blind to Damascus.
  10 Ananias is sent to him, by whom he is re-
  stored to sight, and baptized: he straightway
  preacheth Christ boldly. 23 The Jews of Da-
  mascus seek to kill him; 26 he goeth to Jeru-
  salem, and is brought to the apostles by Bar-
  nabas; preaching boldly against the Grecians,
  he is again in danger of his life, and is sent to
  Tarsus. 31 The church hath rest, and is mul-
  tiplied. 32 Peter cureth Eneas of the palsy
  at Lydda; 36 and raiseth Tabitha to life at
  Joppa.

Chapter 10
1 Cornelius, a devout centurion, being commanded
  by an angel, sendeth for Peter; 9 who in the
  mean time is prepared by an heavenly vision:
  17 and, receiving a command from the Spirit,
  goeth with the messengers to Cesarea. 25 Cor-
  nelius receiveth him with great respect, and
  sheweth the occasion of his sending for him.
  34 Peter preacheth Christ to him and his com-
  pany: 44 the Holy Ghost falleth on them,
  whereupon they are baptized.

Chapter 11
1 Peter, being accused for conversing with the
  Gentiles, maketh his defence; the church is
  satisfied, and glorifieth God. 19 The gospel
  having spread as far as Phenice, Cyprus, and
  Antioch, 22 Barnabas is sent thither, who
  fetcheth Saul from Tarsus; many people are
  taught at Antioch, where the disciples are first
  called Christians. 27 Agabus prophesieth a
  dearth; the disciples send relief from Antioch
  to the brethren in Judea by Barnabas and Saul.

Chapter 12
1 King Herod persecuteth the Christians, killeth
  James, and imprisoneth Peter, who upon the
  prayers of the church is delivered by an angel.
  20 Herod, in his pride assuming the glory due to
  God, is smitten by an angel, and dieth miserably.
  24 After his death the word of God prospereth.
  25 Barnabas and Saul return to Antioch.

Chapter 13
1 Barnabas and Saul, being set apart with fasting
  and prayer, are sent forth by the Holy Ghost to
  the work of their calling. 6 At Paphos Ely-
  mas the sorcerer opposing the gospel is smitten
  with blindness, and the deputy Sergius Paulus
  converted to the faith. 13 Paul and his com-
  pany come to Antioch in Pisidia: Paul preacheth
  Christ, and the necessity of faith in him unto
  justification. 42 The Gentiles desire to hear the
  word again: many are converted. 44 The en-
  vious Jews gainsay and blaspheme: the apostles
  profess to turn to the Gentiles, of whom many
  believe. 50 The Jews raise a persecution, and
  expel Paul and Barnabas, who go to Iconium.

Chapter 14
1 Paul and Barnabas are persecuted from Iconium
  by the malice of the unbelieving Jews. 8 At
  Lystra they heal an impotent man, and refuse
  divine honours with abhorrence. 19 Paul is
  stoned at the instigation of the Jews, but escapeth
  alive with Barnabas to Derbe. 21 Having passed
  through divers places, and confirmed the churches
  in faith and patience, they return to Antioch,
  and give an account of their ministry.

Chapter 15
1 Great dissensions arise about circumcising the
  Gentiles: Paul and Barnabas are sent to consult
  the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. 5 The
  matter is debated in a council there; 7 Peter
  declareth his opinion: 12 Paul and Barnabas
  report the miracles they had wrought among the
  Gentiles. 13 James pronounceth sentence in
  favour of the Gentiles, requiring of them absti-
  nence only in a few particulars. 22 Letters are
  sent with determination by messengers to the
  churches, which are received with joy. 36 Paul
  and Barnabas propose to visit together the
  churches they had planted, but disagree, and
  travel different ways.

Chapter 16
1 Paul having circumcised Timothy, and taken
  him for his companion, passeth through divers
  countries, 9 and is directed by a vision to go
  into Macedonia. 14 He converteth Lydia, 16
  and casteth out a spirit of divination. 19 He
  and Silas are whipped and imprisoned: 25 the
  prison doors are thrown open by an earthquake
  at midnight; the jailor, prevented by Paul
  from killing himself, is converted: 35 they are
  released by the magistrates.

Chapter 17
1 Paul preaching in the synagogue at Thessalonica,
  some believe, both Jews and Greeks. 5 The
  unbelieving Jews raise an uproar. 10 Paul
  and Silas are sent to Berea: the Berean Jews
  are commended for searching the scriptures.
  13 The Jews of Thessalonica follow and drive
  Paul from Berea. 16 At Athens Paul dis-
  puting is carried before the court of Areopagus:
  22 he preacheth the living God, to the Athe-
  nians unknown; his general call to repentance;
  the resurrection of Christ; and his coming to
  judgment. 32 Some mock, others believe.

Chapter 18
1 Paul worketh for his subsistence, and preacheth
  Christ at Corinth, first to the Jews, and,
  upon their opposing and blaspheming, to the
  Gentiles with more success: 9 he is encouraged
  by the Lord in a vision, and abideth there a
  long time. 12 The Jews accuse him before
  Gallio the deputy, who will have nothing to do
  with them. 18 Paul passeth from city to city,
  confirming the disciples. 24 Apollos, instructed
  more perfectly in the Christian doctrine by Aquila
  and Priscilla, preacheth it at Ephesus, and af-
  terward in Achaia, with great efficacy.

Chapter 19
1 The Holy Ghost is conferred by Paul on twelve
  of John's disciples. 8 He preacheth at Ephesus,
  first in the synagogue, and afterward in a pri-
  vate school for two years; God confirming the
  word by special miracles. 13 Certain Jewish
  exorcists, attempting to cast out a devil in the
  name of Jesus, are sent off naked and wound-
  ed: the gospel gaineth credit, and magical books
  are burned. 21 Paul proposing to depart soon,
  Demetrius and the silversmiths raise an uproar
  against him, which is with some difficulty
  appeased.

Chapter 20
1 Paul goeth to Macedonia, and having passed
  over divers countries cometh to Troas; 7
  where as he preached long, Eutychus falleth
  out of a window, and is taken up dead: Paul
  restoreth him to life. 13 He continueth his tra-
  vels; 17 at Miletus he calleth to him the el-
  ders of the church of Ephesus, and taketh a
  solemn and affectionate leave of them, exhort-
  ing them to look well to their charge, and com-
  mending them to God's grace: 36 he prayeth
  with them, and departeth.

Chapter 21
1 Paul journeying to Jerusalem calleth at the
  house of Philip the evangelist, whose four
  daughters prophesied. 10 Agabus foretelling
  what should befal him at Jerusalem, he will not
  be dissuaded from going thither. 17 Arriving
  at Jerusalem, he is persuaded to purify himself in
  the temple, 27 where he is set upon by the Jews
  of Asia, and in danger of losing his life in an
  uproar, but is rescued by the chief captain, and
  carried to the castle in chains; 37 he requesteth,
  and is permitted, to speak to the people.

Chapter 22
1 Paul declareth at large the manner of his con-
  version and call to the apostleship. 22 At the
  very mentioning of the Gentiles the people ex-
  claim furiously against him: whereupon the
  chief captain ordereth to examine him by scourg-
  ing: 25 which he avoideth by pleading the
  privilege of a Roman citizen. 30 He is brought
  before the Jewish council.

Chapter 23
1 Paul pleading his integrity is smitten at the
  command of the high priest, whom he reprov-
  eth of injustice. 6 By declaring himself a Pha-
  risee, and questioned for the hope of the resur-
  rection, he causeth a division in the council:
  10 he is carried back to the castle, and encou-
  raged by the Lord in a vision. 12 A conspi-
  racy against him is discovered to the chief cap-
  tain; 23 who sendeth him under a guard with
  a letter to Felix the governor at Cesarea.

Chapter 24
1 Paul is accused before Felix by Tertullus in the
  name of the Jews: 10 he answereth in defence
  of his life and doctrine. 22 The hearing is de-
  ferred. 24 Paul preaching freely before the go-
  vernor and his wife, Felix trembleth. 26 Felix
  hopeth for a bribe to release Paul, but in vain;
  and going out of his office leaveth him bound.

Chapter 25
1 The Jews accuse Paul to Festus, first at Jeru-
  salem, and afterward at Cesarea: 8 he an-
  swereth for himself, and appealeth to Cesar:
  his appeal is admitted 13 Festus being visited
  by king Agrippa openeth the matter to him, who
  desireth to hear Paul. 23 Paul is brought
  forth; Festus declareth he found nothing in him
  worthy of death.

Chapter 26
1 Paul in the presence of Agrippa declareth his
  life from his childhood, his wonderful conversion,
  and call to the apostleship, and his preaching of
  Christ according to the scripture doctrine. 24
  Festus chargeth him with madness; his modest
  reply, and address to Agrippa, who confesseth
  himself almost a Christian. 30 The whole com-
  pany pronounce him innocent.

Chapter 27
1 Paul is conducted in a ship toward Rome: 9 he
  foretelleth the danger of the voyage, but is not
  credited: 12 the ship setting sail against his
  advice is tossed with a tempest: 21 Paul com-
  forteth his fellow travellers with assurances of
  having their lives saved, but foretelleth a ship-
  wreck: all which is verified by the event.

Chapter 28
1 Paul and his company after their Shipwreck are
  kindly entertained by the barbarians of Melita:
  3 a viper fastening on his hand without hurting
  him, the people, who at first thought ill of him,
  believe him a god: 7 he healeth the father of
  Publius, and other sick persons in the island.
  11 Paul and his company depart, and arrive at
  Rome; where Paul is left with a guard in a
  house of his own. 17 He calleth the Jews to-
  gether, and sheweth the occasion of his coming:
  23 he preacheth Christ to them, of whom some
  believe, others believe not: 30 he continueth
  for two whole years to preach the gospel without
  interruption.

(Romans)

Chapter 1
1 Paul, commending to the Romans his calling,
  greeteth them, 8 and professeth his concern for,
  and desire of coming to see, them. 16 He
  sheweth that the gospel is for the justification of
  all mankind through faith; 18 and having pre-
  mised that sinners in general are obnoxious to
  God's wrath, he describeth at large the corrup-
  tions of the Gentile world.

Chapter 2
1 They that condemn sin in others, and are guilty
  of the like themselves, cannot escape God's judg-
  ment; 6 which will be according to every man's
  deserts, without distinction of Jew or Gentile.
  14 The Gentiles are not left without a rule of
  conduct. 17 The Jew, who boasteth of greater
  light, is doubly criminal in sinning against it;
  25 nor will circumcision profit him, except he
  keep the law.

Chapter 3
1 The Jew's perogative: 3 which is not vacated
  by the unbelief of some; 5 nor is God's justice
  impeached in punishing their sinfulness. 9 The
  law itself convinceth the Jews also universally
  of sin; 20 so that no flesh is justified by the
  deeds of the law; 21 but all indiscriminately
  by God's grace through faith in Christ: 31 yet
  without annulling the obligations of the law.

Chapter 4
1 Abraham himself was justified by faith: 9
  which was imputed to him for righteousness
  before circumcision, that he might be the com-
  mon father of believers, whether circumcised
  or not. 13 The promise was not given him
  through the law, else had it been void from
  the very nature of the law; but being of faith
  by grace is sure to all the destined seed, and
  not to those of the law only. 18 The accept-
  ableness of Abraham's faith; 23 which stands
  recorded not for his sake only, but for the sake
  of all who shall profess a like faith in God
  through Christ.

Chapter 5
1 Being justified by faith, we have peace with
  God: 2 we glory in our hopes; 3 and in present
  afflictions; 6 from the past experience of God's
  love looking with more assurance for final sal-
  vation: 11 we glory in God also, to whom we
  are reconciled by Christ. 12 As sin and death
  came upon all men by Adam, so the grace of
  God, which justifieth unto life, cometh more
  abundantly unto all mankind through Christ.
  20 Under the law sin abounded unto death;
  but grace hath much more abounded unto life.

Chapter 6
1 Though justified by grace, we may not live in
  sin; since the very figure of baptism requireth us
  to die with Christ unto sin, that we may lead
  a new life of holiness unto God. 14 The dis-
  pensation of grace freeth us from the dominion
  of sin; but we are still the servants of sin, if
  we obey it; therefore being freed from sin, we
  are bound unto holiness. 21 The end and
  wages of sin is death; but the fruit of holiness
  through God's grace is eternal life.

Chapter 7
1 No law having power over a person longer
  than he liveth, 4 we therefore, being become
  dead to the law by the body of Christ, are left
  free to place ourselves under a happier dispen-
  sation. 5 For the law through the prevalency
  of corrupt passions could only serve as an instru-
  ment of sin unto death; although it be in itself
  holy, and just, and good; 14 as is manifest by
  our reason approving the precepts of it, whilst
  our depraved nature is unable to put them in
  practice. 24 The wretchedness of man in such
  a situation, and God's mercy in his deliverance
  from it through Christ.

Chapter 8
1 Under the gospel we are free from condemnation,
  walking after the spirit. 5 The evil of being
  carnally minded. 9 Christians have God's spirit
  to guide and assist them; 12 by which if they
  mortify the flesh, they shall live. 14 For they
  that are led by the spirit are sons of God, and
  heirs of glory; 19 whose manifestation the
  world hath long earnestly looked for, hoping to
  be rescued thereby from the bondage of corrup-
  tion; 23 and even they who have the first-
  fruits of the spirit do still long after it; 24
  being hitherto saved by hope only; 26 the spi-
  rit in the mean time aiding their infirmities in
  prayer. 28 Nevertheles the final good of them
  that fear God is all along pursued, being fore-
  ordained of God, and brought about according
  to the course of his providence. 31 The ground
  and assurance of the Christian's hope.

Chapter 9
1 Paul professeth an unfeigned sorrow for the
  Jewish nation: 6 but proveth by instances from
  scripture that the promise of Abraham did not
  necessarily include all his descendants: 14 as-
  serting that there is no unrighteousness in God's
  bestowing his unmerited bounty on whom he
  pleaseth: 19 and that he was unquestionably
  free to suspend his judgments, where deserved,
  either for the more signal display of his power
  in taking vengeance on some, or of his mercy
  in calling others to glory. 25 The calling of
  the Gentiles, and rejection of the Jews, foretold.
  30 Accordingly the Gentiles have attained the
  righteousness of faith; which the Jews refused.
  32 The cause of such refusal.

Chapter 10
1 Paul's prayer for Israel, who were misled by
  blind zeal. 4 The difference between justifica-
  tion by the law and by faith explained from
  scripture. 11 Salvation open to all that believe,
  both Jews and Gentiles. 14 The necessity of
  preaching to the Gentiles inferred. 19 God's
  acceptance of the Gentiles known before to the
  Jews; 21 as also their own refusal of his of-
  fered mercy.

Chapter 11
1 God hath not so far cast off all Israel, but that
  a remnant is saved by grace, not by works. 7
  The judicial blindness of the rest is prophesied
  of in scripture. 11 The consequence both of
  their fall and conversion with regard to the
  Gentile world. 17 The Gentiles are cautioned
  not to insult the Jews, but to make a proper
  use of the example both of God's goodness and
  severity. 23 The Jews may, and shall in time,
  believe and be saved. 33 God's judgments and
  ways are unsearchable.

Chapter 12
1 Paul exhorteth to holiness and conformity to
  God's will: and to think soberly of the gifts
  alloted every man respectively. 4 We are all
  members of one body in Christ, 6 and should
  diligently exercise our several gifts for the com-
  mon benefit. 9 Sundry practical duties recom-
  mended. 19 Revenge is specially forbidden,
  and to do good for evil injoined.

Chapter 13
1 Subjection to magistrates enforced. 7 We must
  render to all their dues: 8 only love is a debt
  we must always owe, and virtually containeth
  the whole law. 11 Rioting, drunkenness, and
  other works of darkness, must be put away, as
  much out of season under the gospel.

Chapter 14
1 Directions to treat a weak brother kindly, and
  not to despise or censure one another in matters
  of indifference. 7 Christ's right to our best
  services, whether we live or die. 10 We must
  all be answerable for our respective conduct
  at his judgment seat. 13 We must be careful not
  to use our Christian liberty to the hurt or offence
  of tender consciences.

Chapter 15
1 We ought, in condescension to the weak, to give
  up our own will for our neighbor's good, after
  the example of Christ. 4 The intent of the scrip-
  tures. 5 Paul prayeth for unanimity among
  Christians, 7 exhorteth to receive one the other,
  as Christ did all, both Jews, and Gentiles; 13
  and wisheth them all joy, peace, and hope. 14
  He apologiseth for his freedom in admonishing
  them, as he was the apostle of the Gentiles; 17
  and sheweth the success and extensiveness of his
  labours. 22 He excuseth his not coming to
  them before, and promiseth them a visit on his
  return from Jerusalem. 30 He requesteth their
  prayers.

Chapter 16
1 Paul commendeth Phebe to the Christians at
  Rome, 3 and sendeth salutations to many by
  name. 17 He warneth them to take heed of
  those who cause divisions and offences. 21 After
  sundry salutations, 25 he concludeth with praise
  to God.

(1 Corinthians)

Chapter 1
1 After saluting the church at Corinth, 4 and
  thanking God for his grace toward them, 10
  Paul exhorteth them to unity, 11 and reprov-
  eth their dissensions, 17 The plain doctrine of
  the gospel, how foolish soever in the eyes of the
  world, is the power and wisdom of God to the
  salvation of believers. 26 God, to take away
  human boasting, hath not called the wise, the
  mighty, the noble; but the foolish, the weak, the
  despised among men. 30 Christ is our wisdom,
  righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.

Chapter 2
1 Paul declareth that he used not human learning
  and eloquence in preaching the gospel to his
  converts, that their faith, being built on the
  testimony of the spirit, and on miracles, might
  be solely ascribed to God. 6 The gospel doth
  contain God's wise, but secret, counsel for bringing
  men to glory; which no natural abilities could
  discover, but the Spirit of God only, by which
  it was revealed to the apostles. 14 Upon this
  account both the doctrine and its teachers are
  held in disesteem by the mere natural man, who
  is not duly qualified to judge of and discern
  them.

Chapter 3
1 Paul sheweth that he could not instruct the Co-
  rinthians in the higher doctrines of Christianity
  because of their carnal mind; 3 which temper
  discovered itself in their factions. 5 The most
  eminent preachers of the gospel are but instru-
  ments employed by God in building his church.
  10 Paul hath laid the only true foundation,
  Christ Jesus; and others must take heed what
  they build thereon. 16 Christians are God's
  temple, not to be defiled. 18 Worldly wisdom is
  foolishness with God. 21 They that are Christ's
  must not glory in men.

Chapter 4
1 Paul sheweth in what account such as he should
  be held, of whose fidelity it should be left to God
  to judge. 6 He dissaudeth the Corinthians from
  valuing themselves in one teacher above another,
  since all had their respective distinctions from
  God. 8 To their selfsufficient vanity he opposeth
  his own despised and afflicted state; 14 warning
  them, as their only father in Christ, and urging
  them to follow him. 17 For the same cause he
  sent Timotheus, and meant soon to follow in
  person, when he would enquire into the autho-
  rity of such as opposed him.

Chapter 5
1 Paul reproveth a scandalous incest committed and
  protected from censure in the church at Corinth;
  3 and by his authority in Christ excommuni-
  cateth the offender. 6 The necessity of purging
  out the old leaven. 9 Christians guilty of noto-
  rious crimes are not to be consorted with.

Chapter 6
1 The Corinthians are reproved for bringing their
  controversies before heathen judges, which they
  ought to decide among themselves. 7 There
  would be no occasion for lawsuits, if men
  acted up to the principles of the gospel, 9 which
  exclude from the kingdom of God all notorious
  transgressors of the moral law.  12 All lawful
  things are not expedient; 15 but fornication is
  a gross offence against our bodies, which are
  members of Christ, temples of the Holy Ghost,
  and not our own to dispose of otherwise than to
  God's glory.

Chapter 7
1 Marriage is to be used as a remedy against for-
  nication. 10 Christ hath forbidden to dissolve
  the bond thereof. 12 Directions how to act
  where one of the parties is an unbeliever. 17
  Every man must abide in and fulfil the duties of
  the state wherein he was called. 25 Directions
  concerning the marriage of virgins, respecting
  the distress of the times; 39 and concerning the
  second marriage of widows.

Chapter 8
1 The preference of charity to knowledge. 4 An
  idol is nothing in the esteem of those who have
  right notions of one God, and of one Lord Jesus
  Christ. 7 But it is sin in those, who by an in-
  discreet use of their knowledge, in eating meats
  offered to idols, tempt weaker consciences to
  offend.

Chapter 9
1 Paul vindicateth his apostolical character, 3
  and right to a maintenance from the churches;
  15 though he relinquished that right for the
  furtherance of the gospel, not content with doing
  only his indispensable duty; 19 but voluntarily
  subjecting himself in many points, where he was
  otherwise free, in order thereby to win over
  more converts to Christ. 24 those who con-
  tend for a corruptible crown use much labour
  and abstinence; 26 so doth the apostle strive
  for one that is incorruptible.

Chapter 10
1 The Jews who came out of Egypt had all sa-
  craments typical of our's, yet many of them pe-
  rished through sin. 6 Their examples should
  serve, as they were intended, for our admoni-
  tion. 13 God will not suffer his servants to
  be tempted beyond their strength. 14 Christians
  must flee idolatry, and not by partaking of idol
  sacrifices own fellowship with devils. 23 Even
  in the use of things lawful we should consult
  the good of others, 31 and refer all we do to
  God's glory, 32 careful to give none offence,
  after the apostle's own example.

Chapter 11
1 Paul exhorteth the Corinthians to follow him, as
  he did Christ. 2 He praiseth them for observ-
  ing the rules he had given them; 3 and for-
  biddeth men to pray or prophesy with heads
  covered, and women with heads uncovered; the
  covering of the head being a token of subjec-
  tion. 17 He blameth them for abuses in their
  religious assemblies, particularly for their divi-
  sions, 20 and profanation of the Lord's supper.
  23 He remindeth them of the first institution
  thereof, and sheweth the danger of partaking
  of it unworthily.

Chapter 12
1 Paul teacheth that none can own Christ but by
  the Holy Ghost; 4 whose gifts are diverse, 7
  and dealt out to different persons to profit
  withal. 12 As many members make up one
  natural body, so Christians in general form
  one mystical body: 14 and as every member is
  equally a part of the natural body, and hath
  a necessary function allotted it; 27 so is it with
  Christ's body, the church; to the several mem-
  bers of which God hath assigned different gifts
  and offices for the general good.

Chapter 13
1 All gifts, how excellent soever, without cha-
  rity are nothing worth. 4 The praises of cha-
  rity, 13 and it's preference to faith and hope.

Chapter 14
1 Prophecy for its greater tendency to edification
  is preferred before speaking with tongues. 6
  Tongues not understood, like indistinct musical
  sounds, are of no service to the hearers. 12
  All gifts should be referred to edification. 21
  Tongues are of use for the conviction of unbe-
  lievers; 23 but in the assemblies of the church
  prophecy is more useful. 26 Rules for the or-
  derly exercise of spiritual gifts in the church.
  34 Women are forbidden to speak there. 39
  An exhortation to use each gift freely, but with
  decency and order.

Chapter 15
1 From the truth of Christ's resurrection Paul in-
  ferreth the necessity of our own. 20 Christ, the
  firstfruits, being raised, shall be followed in due
  order by those that are his; 24 till having sub-
  dued all enemies shall give up the kingdom to
  God the father. 29 If there be no resurrection
  of the dead, in vain is it for any one to risk his
  life, as the apostle did, continually. 35 The
  manner of the resurrection. 51 The change
  which shall be wrought at the last day in the
  bodies both of the dead and the living. 58 An
  exhortation to stedfast faith and perseverance in
  our duty.

Chapter 16
1 Paul directeth the Corinthians how to proceed
  in their collections for the relief of the brethren
  at Jerusalem. 5 He mentioneth his design of
  visiting them, 10 and commendeth Timothy, who
  was coming to them. 13 After some seasona-
  ble admonitions, 19 he closeth the epistle with
  divers salutations.

(2 Corinthians)

Chapter 1
1 Paul saluteth the Corinthians; 3 and blesseth
  God for the comforts and deliverances given
  him, not solely for his own sake, but for the
  comfort and encouragement of others also. 8
  He telleth them of a deliverance he had lately
  had from a great danger in Asia, and expresseth
  his trust in God's protection for the future
  through their prayers. 12 He calleth both his
  own conscience and their's to witness his sincerity
  in preaching the gospel; 15 and excuseth his
  not coming to them, as not proceeding from
  lightness, 23 but from lenity toward them.

Chapter 2
1 Paul having shewn a motive of tenderness for
  not coming to Corinth, as also for writing his
  former epistle, 6 declareth himself satisfied with
  the censure inflicted on the incestuous person,
  and desireth them to forgive and comfort him,
  10 as he himself had forgiven him in Christ's
  name. 12 His uneasiness for not finding Titus
  at Troas had caused him to go forthwith into
  Macedonia. 14 He blesseth God for the suc-
  cessfulness of his labours every where, 17  pro-
  fessing his sincerity and disinterestedness before
  God.

Chapter 3
1 To obviate the imputation of vain glory, Paul
  sheweth that the gifts and graces of the Corin-
  thians were a sufficient commendation of his
  ministry, 4 the efficacy of which he ascribeth
  entirely to God. 6 He proveth the superior ex-
  cellency of the gospel ministry to that of the
  law; 12 and thereupon justifieth his plain
  speaking, as under a dispensation of greater light
  and liberty than that of Moses.

Chapter 4
1 Paul declareth his unwearied zeal and integrity
  in preaching the gospel; 3 so that if any see not
  the truth of it, it must be owing to their corrupt
  hearts, not to want of clear light. 7 The weak-
  ness and sufferings he was exposed to redounded
  to the praise of God's power. 12 That which
  animated him in undergoing them for the
  church's sake was the assurance of a more ex-
  ceeding and eternal reward.

Chapter 5
1 Paul declareth that in assured hope of a blessed
  immortality hereafter he was indifferent to life,
  and laboured only to approve himself to Christ:
  10 that knowing the general judgment that
  would follow, and the terrors of it, he was sol-
  licitous to persuade men: 12 that this was said
  not by way of boasting, but purely to furnish the
  Corinthians with a reply in his justification
  against false pretenders: 14 that moved by the
  love of Christ, he was become dead to all former
  regards; 17 and all things being now made new
  by God in Christ reconciling the world to him-
  self, 20 he, as ambassador for Christ, besought
  men to embrace the offered reconciliation.

Chapter 6
1 Paul intreateth the Corinthians not to frustrate
  God's grace: 3 setting forth his own inoffen-
  sive, painful, and patient, demeanour in the dis-
  charge of his ministry: 11 of which he telleth
  them he spake more freely out of the great love
  he bare them; 13 challenging the like affection
  from them in return. 14 He dissuadeth from
  any intimate connexions with unbelievers. 16
  Christians are the temples of the living God.

Chapter 7
1 Paul exhorteth the Corinthians to purity of life,
  2 and to receive him, who had done nothing to
  forfeit their esteem: 3 he repeateth the assurance
  of his love for them, and sheweth what comfort
  he had received in all his troubles from the report
  which Titus had brought of their good disposi-
  tions toward him: 8 so that upon the whole he
  did not repent of having grieved them a little by
  letter, considering the good effects which that
  godly sorrow had produced. 13 Above all he
  rejoiced to observe the good impressions which
  their behaviour, so answerable to his former
  boastings of them, had left in the mind of Titus.

Chapter 8
1 Paul extolleth the liberal contributions of the
  Macedonian churches for the relief of the bre-
  thren in Judea: 6 and recommendeth the like
  charity to the Corinthians, as well beseeming
  their other graces, 9 enforced by Christ's exam-
  ple, 10 consistent with the alacrity they had al-
  ready expressed therein, 13 and a precedent
  which might in time be of use to themselves.
  16 He letteth them know the willingness of
  Titus to come and further this good work among
  them; and commendeth him to their love, to-
  gether with the brethren, men of special worth,
  who were sent with him on the same errand.

Chapter 9
1 Paul sheweth the reason why, though he knew
  the forwardness of the Corinthians, he had sent
  the brethren beforehand to make up their collec-
  tions against his coming. 6 He stirreth them
  up to give bountifully and cheerfully, as a likely
  means to increase their store, 12 and as pro-
  ductive of many thanksgivings unto God.

Chapter 10
1 Paul intreateth the Corinthians not to leave him
  cause to exert against them that spiritual power,
  with which he was armed, and meant to chas-
  tise those, who undervalued his person and
  apostolical character. 12 He pointeth out the
  difference between those, who for want of look-
  ing beyond themselves were arrogant and vain,
  intruding into and taking merit from, the la-
  bours of others, and himself, who kept strictly
  within the province allotted him by God, and
  avoiding selfcommendation, sought honour from
  the commendation of Christ.

Chapter 11
1 Paul unwillingly entereth upon a commendation
  of himself, out of jealousy lest the Corinthians
  should be perverted by false apostles from the pure
  doctrine of Christ. 5 He sheweth that he was
  in all respects equal to the chiefest apostles; 7
  that he declined being chargeable to them not for
  want of love toward them, but to cut off occa-
  sion from those deceitful workers of taking shelter
  under his example: 16 that he was not inferior
  to those, whom they so patiently submitted to,
  in any of their boasted prerogatives, 23 but
  as a minister of Christ, in labours and sufferings
  for the gospel's sake, was abundantly their su-
  perior.

Chapter 12
1 Paul sheweth that, though he had been favoured
  with visions and revelations, 5 yet for commen-
  dation of his apostleship he chose rather to glory
  in his infirmities: 11 blaming the Corinthians,
  who had seen in him all the signs of an apostle,
  for forcing him to such vain boasting. 14 He
  telleth them of his design of visiting them again
  with the same disinterestedness and fatherly af-
  fection as before. 16 He justifieth himself from
  any crafty extortion by his messengers; 20 and
  expresseth his fears, lest, both to his sorrow and
  theirs, he should find many notorious disorders
  still unredressed among them.

Chapter 13
1 Paul threateneth to vindicate his authority at
  his coming by punishing severely unreclaimed
  offenders. 5 He adviseth the Corinthians to
  try if they had as good proofs of their faith,
  as he trusted to have of his mission. 7 He
  wisheth that by a blameless conversation they
  might prevent him from using sharpness toward
  them, whatever became of his proofs. 11 He
  concludeth with an exhortation, salutation,
  and prayer.

(Galatians)

Chapter 1
1 After saluting the churches of Galatia, 6 Paul
  testifieth his surprise that they should so soon
  have forsaken the truth of the gospel which he
  had taught them; 8 and pronounced those ac-
  cursed who preach any other gospel. 10 He shew-
  eth that his doctrine was not concerted to please
  men, but came to him by immediate revelation
  from God. 13 To confirm which he relateth
  his conversation before his calling, 15 and what
  steps he had taken immediately thereupon.

Chapter 2
1 Paul sheweth for what purpose after many
  years he went to Jerusalem; 3 that Titus, who
  went with him, was not circumcised, and that
  on purpose to assert the freedom of the Gentile
  converts from the bondage of the law; 6 that
  no new knowledge was added to him in confer-
  ence with the three chief apostles, but that he
  received from them a public acknowledgment of
  his divine mission to the Gentiles; 11 that he
  openly withstood Peter for dissimulation with
  respect to Gentile communion, 14 expostulating
  with him, why he, who believed that justifica-
  tion came by the faith of Christ, acted as though
  it came by the works of the law; 21 which
  was in effect to frustrate the grace of God.

Chapter 3
1 Paul asketh what had moved the Galatians to
  depend on the law, having already received
  the spirit through faith. 6 As Abraham was
  justified by faith, so they who are of faith
  inherit his blessing. 10 The law brought
  men under a curse, and could not justify. 13
  Christ hath freed us from the curse, and laid
  open the blessing to all believers. 15 Supposing
  that the law justified, God's covenant with
  Abraham would be void. 19 But the law
  was only a temporary provision against sin till
  Christ's coming, and in no wise contrary to
  God's promises: 23 serving as a schoolmaster
  to prepare men for Christ. 25 But faith being
  come, the law is at an end, and all believers
  are without distinction become children of God
  and heirs of the promise.

Chapter 4
1 The Jews were for a while held under the law,
  as an heir under his guaradian till he be of age.
  4 But Christ came to redeem those that were
  under the law, and to give both to Jew and
  Gentile the adoption, and consequently the free-
  dom, of sons. 8 Paul therefore reproveth the
  Galatians, who from serving idols had been re-
  ceived of God, for falling back to the bondage
  of legal observances. 11 He expresseth his fears
  and tender regard for them, and calleth to
  mind their former respect and good will to him,
  from which he admonisheth them not to be
  seduced in his absence. 21 He allegorically
  describeth the Jewish and Christian churches
  under the types of Agar and Sara, and inferreth
  that we, being children of the freewoman,
  are free.

Chapter 5
1 Paul exhorteth the Galatians to maintain their
  Christian liberty, 2 and sheweth that by being
  circumcised they would forfeit their hopes in
  Christ. 7 He disclaimeth the preaching of cir-
  cumcision himself, and condemneth it in others.
  13 He adviseth them not to abuse their liberty,
  but to serve one another in love, which com-
  prehendeth the whole law. 16 The opposition
  between the flesh and the spirit: 19 The works
  of the flesh: 22 The fruits of the spirit. 25
  Advice to walk in the spirit, and not in vain-
  glorious emulation.

Chapter 6
1 Paul adviseth them to reform the faulty with
  gentleness, 2 and to bear one another's burdens.
  3 A caution against vanity. 6 He exhorteth
  to be liberal toward spiritual instructers: 9
  and not to be weary in doing good. 12 He
  sheweth the carnal views of those who preachea
  circumcision, 14 and his own professed depend-
  ence on Christ only, regardless of the world. 8
  He concludeth with a prayer.

(Ephesians)

Chapter 1
1 After saluting the Ephesians, 3 Paul blesseth God
  for his spiritual blessings on those whom he had
  chosen in Christ, and predestinated to the adop-
  tion of children; 7 for our redemption by his
  grace, according to his revealed purpose of ga-
  thering together all in one under Christ; 11
  for the inheritance already obeained by those
  who first trusted in Christ; 13 and for the
  spirit given to after believers, as an earnest
  of the same. 15 He declareth his continual
  thankfulness to God for their faith, and his
  prayers that God would perfect them in the
  knowledge of those things, which concerned
  their state in Christ, 20 whom God had raised
  up, and exhalted to be the supreme head of his
  body the church.

Chapter 2
1 Paul setteth before the Ephesians their former
  corrupt heathen state, 4 and God's rich mercy
  in their deliverance. 8 We are saved by grace,
  not of works, yet so as to be created in Christ
  unto good works. 11 They who were once
  strangers, and far from God, are now brought
  near by Christ's blood, who having abolished
  the ritual law, the ground of distinction be-
  tween Jew and Gentile, hath united both in
  one body, and gained them equal access to the
  Father. 19 So that the Gentiles are henceforth
  equally privileged with the Jews, and together
  with them constitute an holy temple for the
  habitation of God's Spirit.

Chapter 3
1 Paul, in bonds for preaching Christ to the Gen-
  tiles, sheweth that the mystery of their calling,
  heretofor hidden, had been revealed to him, 7
  that by his ministry God's gracious purpose
  might be universally known, and the Gentiles
  be assured of their acceptance by faith. 13 He
  desireth his Ephesian converts not to be discou-
  raged at his sufferings on their account; 14
  and prayeth that God would strengthen their
  faith and knowledge of the infinite love of
  Christ. 20 He giveth glory to God for his
  power in the church by Christ Jesus.

Chapter 4
1 Paul exhorteth to those virtues which become
  the Christian calling, particularly to unity: 7
  declaring that Christ gave his gifts differently,
  that his body the church might be built up and
  perfected in the true faith by the cooperation
  of the several members with one another, and
  with him their head. 17 He calleth men off
  from the vain and impure conversation of the
  heathen world, 22 to renounce the old, and to
  put on the new, man: 25 to discard lying, 26
  and sinful anger; 28 to leave off dishonest prac-
  tices, and to gain by honest labour what they
  have occasion for; 29 to use no corrupt talk,
  30 nor grieve God's spirit; 31 to put away
  all expressions of ill will, and to practice mu-
  tual kindness and forgiveness.

Chapter 5
1 Paul exhorteth to the imitation of God, and of
  the love of Christ: 3 to avoid fornication and
  all uncleanness, 5 which exclude from the
  kingdom of God, and draw down God's wrath
  on unbelievers: 7 with whose works of dark-
  ness Christians, that have better light to inform
  and influence them, should have no fellowship:
  15 to walk with prudence and circumspection;
  18 not to drink wine to excess, but to be filled
  with the spirit, singing psalms, and giving
  thanks to God; 21 and bring in due subordi-
  nation to one another. 22 The duty of wives
  toward their husbands, 25 and of husbands to-
  ward their wives, enforced by the example of
  Christ and his church.

Chapter 6
1 The relative duties of children, 4 and parents;
  5 of servants, 9 and masters. 10 Paul ex-
  horteth the brethren to resist spiritual enemies by
  putting on the whole armour of God, 18 and by
  perseverance in prayer, which he requireth for
  all saints, and particularly for himself, that he
  might preach the gospel with due boldness. 21
  He commendeth Tychicus, 23 and concludeth
  with good wishes to all sincere Christians.

(Philippians)

Chapter 1
1 Paul saluteth the Philippians, 3 and testifieth
  his thankfulness to God for their uninterrupted
  fellowship in the gospel: 8 his affection for
  them, 9 and prayers for their spiritual im-
  provement. 12 He informeth them that his
  bonds at Rome had turned out to the advance-
  ment of the gospel, which many were thereby
  induced to preach, though with different views:
  21 that considering how serviceable his life
  might be to the cause of Christ, though for
  himself it were happier to die, he was doubt-
  ful in his choice: 25 but that he knew he
  should soon be at liberty to visit them again for
  their comfort. 27 He exhorteth them to walk
  worthy of their profession, and to be steady and
  unanimous in the faith, for which they had
  already been fellowsufferers with them.

Chapter 2
1 Paul earnestly recommendeth to the Philippians
  mutual love and union, 3 lowliness of mind,
  4 and that charitable condescension for the good
  of others, exemplified in the life and death of
  Christ, 9 for which God had exalted him to be
  Lord of all. 12 He exhorteth them to careful-
  ness in working out their own salvation, 14 to
  obey the will of God cheerfully and universally,
  that so they might distinguish themselves from
  the rest of the world by a bright example of
  virtue; 16 and by their steadiness give him
  cause to rejoice in the success of his labours,
  who would gladly lay down his life to serve
  them. 19 He hopeth to send Timothy to them
  shortly, whom he greatly commendeth; 21 as
  he doth the affection and zeal of Epaphroditus,
  whom he sendeth with this epistle.

Chapter 3
1 Paul exhorteth to rejoice in the Lord, and to
  beware of the false teachers of the circumci-
  sion: 4 shewing that as a Jew he had better
  grounds of confidence than they; 7 but that he
  disclaimed them all, trusting only to the justi-
  fication which is of God by faith, and hoping
  to partake of the resurrection through Christ.
  12 He acknowledgeth his present imperfection,
  and that he was still anxiously striving for the
  prize: 15 exhorting others to be ikeminded,
  17 and to follow his example; 18 for many
  were enemies to the gospel, being earthly mind-
  ed; 20 but his conversation and views were
  heavenly.

Chapter 4
1 Paul exciteth to stedfastness in Christ, 2 and
  after some particular admonitions, 3 exhorteth
  generally to religious joy, 5 moderation, 6 trust
  in God with prayer, 8 and to every branch of
  moral goodness. 10 He testifieth his joy in the
  care shewn by the Philippians for his supply in
  prison, though being always content he was
  above want; 15 and commendeth their former
  liberality to him, not for his own sake, but for
  the good that would redound to them from it.
  18 He acknowledgeth the receipt of their late
  bounty, assuring them that God would both
  accept and reward it. 20 He giveth glory to God,
  and concludeth with salutations, and a blessing.

(Colossians)

Chapter 1
1 After saluting the saints at Colosse, 3 Paul tes-
  tifieth his thankfulness to God for the good ac-
  count he had heard of their faith and love; 9
  and his continual prayers for their improve-
  mant in spiritual knowledge, right practice, and
  thanksgiving to God for the benefits of redemp-
  tion by his son. 15 He sheweth them the ex-
  alted nature and mediatorial office of Christ, 21
  by whom they, who were once enemies, were
  now reconciled, if they continued true to the
  gospel, 23 whereof he Paul was made a mi-
  nister to preach it to the Gentiles.

Chapter 2
1 Paul testifieth his sollicitude for the churches
  which had not seen him, that they might be
  united in love, and attain a perfect knowledge
  of the Christian revelation, 4 not being se-
  duced from their stedfastness in the faith, 8
  nor corrupted through philosophy and human tra-
  ditions. 9 He sheweth that they were already
  complete in Christ, having attained the true
  circumcision figured in baptism; 13 that God
  had quickened them with Christ, and both abo-
  lished the law of ordinances, that was against
  them, 15 and also spoiled principalities and
  powers. 16 He therefore urgeth them not to
  submit to legal ordinances, which were but a
  shadow of Christ; nor to the worship of angels,
  and other vain practices of human devising.

Chapter 3
1 The apostle exhorteth to be heavenly minded, 5
  to mortify carnal lusts, and to put away all
  malice and ill dealing in respect of one another,
  as becometh Christians; 12 he recommendeth
  brotherly kindness, charity, and other general
  duties. 18 The relative duties of wives, 19
  and husbands: 20 of children, 21 and parents:
  22 and of servants toward their masters.

Chapter 4
1 The duty of masters toward their servants. 2 A
  general exhortation to perseverance in prayer, 5
  discreet conduct, 6 and well ordered speech. 7
  The apostle commendeth Tychicus and Onesimus,
  by whom he sent this epistle: 10 and concludeth
  with divers salutations, and a blessing.

(1 Thessalonians)

Chapter 1
1 The salutation. 2 Paul sheweth his thankful
  remembrance of the Thessalonians in his prayers
  on account of their faith, charity and patience;
  5 applauding them for their exemplary reception
  of the gospel, and improvement under it.

Chapter 2
1 Paul setteth forth in what manner he had
  preached the gospel to the Thessalonians, 13 and
  they had received and suffered for it.  17 He
  sheweth his desire of coming to them, and the
  cause which had hitherto prevented him; 19
  testifying his joy and satisfaction in them.

Chapter 3
1 The apostle sheweth that out of his great care
  for the Thessalonians he had sent Timothy to
  comfort and strengthen them in the faith; 6
  whose good report of them had been a great con-
  solation to him in his distresses. 9 He testifieth
  his thankfulness to God, and earnest desire to see
  them; 11 praying God to guide him to them,
  and for their increase in love and holiness unto
  the end.

Chapter 4
1 Paul exhorteth the Thessalonians to proceed in
  their endeavours to please God by a holy and just
  conversation. 9 He commendeth their love to
  one another, intreating them to abound in it,
  11 and quietly to follow their respective callings.
  13 And that they might not sorrow for the dead,
  as men without hope, he briefly describeth the
  resurrection of the just, and Christ's second coming.

Chapter 5
1 The apostle proceedeth to shew that Christ's
  coming will be sudden, exhorting Christians to
  watch and be sober, so as not to be taken by
  surprize. 12 He beseecheth them to respect
  their spiritual guides; 14 and giveth divers
  other precepts; 23 concluding with a prayer
  and salutations.

(2 Thessalonians)

Chapter 1
1 The salutation. 3 Paul certifieth the Thessalo-
  nians of the good opinion which he had of their
  faith, love, and patience; 6 of the righteous
  judgment of God in punishing their enemies,
  and recompensing their sufferings; 11 and of his
  prayers that God would fulfil his gracious pur-
  pose in them.

Chapter 2
1 Paul warneth the Thessalonians against a ground-
  less surmise that the day of Christ was near at
  hand; 3 shewing that it would be preceeded by a
  great apostasy, and that the man of sin would
  be first revealed, and by his wicked impostures
  draw many into perdition. 13 He repeateth
  his good hopes concerning them, 15 exhorting
  them to stand and fast in his doctrine, and praying
  God to comffort and stablish them in all goodness.

Chapter 3
1 The Apostle desireth the Thessalonians to pray
  for him, 3 testifying his confidence in them, 5
  and praying God to direct them. 6 He censureth
  the idle and disorderly, and requireth others to
  abstain from their company: 16 concluding
  with prayer and salutation.

(1 Timothy)

Chapter 1
1 The salutation. 3 Timothy is put in mind of the
  charge before given him by Paul. 5 The end of
  the commandment is charity, from which some
  had turned aside to teach the law which they
  understood not. 8 The scope of the law was to
  condemn wickedness, which is the design of the
  gospel also. 12 Paul blesseth God for calling him
  to the ministry notwithstanding his great de-
  merit, whereby all penitent sinners that believe
  are assured of mercy through Christ. 18 He
  urgeth Timothy to a due discharge of his trust,
  warning him of some who had deserted the truth,
  of whom Hymeneus and Alexander had been de-
  livered by him unto Satan.

Chapter 2
1 Paul exhorteth to pray and give thanks for all
  men, for kings and magistrates especially. 4 God
  willeth the salvation of all men. 7 Paul's com-
  mission to teach the Gentiles. 8 He directeth how
  women should be attired; 11 permitteth them
  not to teach; 15 but promiseth that they shall
  be saved in childbearing on certain conditions.

Chapter 3
1 The office of a bishop is to be esteemed a good
  work. 2 The qualifications requisite in a bishop,
  8 and in deacons. 14 Why Paul wrote these
  instructions to Timothy. 16 The important
  truths of the Christian revalation.

Chapter 4
1 Paul foretelleth and describeth a great apostasy
  to happen in the latter times. 6 He directeth
  Timothy what doctrines to teach, 12 and by
  what rules to regulate his conduct, so as to
  save both himself and his hearers.

Chapter 5
1 Directions to Timothy how to admonish persons
  of different conditions. 3 Concerning widows.
  17 Elders, if they do well, are to be doubly
  honoured; 19 and are not to be censured with-
  out full proof; and then openly and impartially.
  22 A caution not to ordain any one precipitately.
  23 Advice respecting Timothy's health. 24
  Some men's characters are more easily discerned
  than those of others.

Chapter 6
1 The duty of servants. 3 Those who teach not
  according to the apostle's doctrine are to be
  avoided, as corrupters of Christianity. 6 The
  gain of godliness with content. 9 The evil of
  covetousness. 11 What Timothy is to flee, and
  what to follow and perform. 17 A charge to
  the rich not to be proud and confident in their
  riches, but to be beneficent and liberal. 20
  Timothy is injoined to adhere to the true faith,
  and to shun profane and vain controversies.

(2 Timothy)

Chapter 1
1 Paul affectionately saluteth Timothy, 3 assuring
  him of his constant prayers for him, and re-
  membrance of that sincere faith which had
  been derived to Timothy from his mother and
  grandmother. 6 He exhorteth him to stir up
  the gift of God which was in him; 8 and not
  to be ashamed of the testimony of the gospel,
  but to be ready to suffer for it according to his
  example: 13 and to hold fast the form of
  sound words which he had learned. 15 He
  putteth him in mind of the general defection of
  the converts in Asia, 16 and commandeth One-
  siphorus for his repeated kindness toward him.

Chapter 2
1 Timothy is exhorted to constancy and perseverance
  in the discharge of his duty, as a good soldier
  of Christ, looking for a certain reward of his
  fatigues and sufferings; 15 to divide the word
  of truth rightly, and to shun profane and vain
  babblings. 17 The dangerous error of Hyme-
  neus and Philetus. 19 The foundation of God
  standeth sure. 20 Of vessels honourable and
  dishonourable. 22 Timothy is taught what to
  flee, and what to follow, and how the servant
  of Christ must behave toward all men.

Chapter 3
1 The apostle foretelleth the evil characters that
  should appear in the last days. 6 He describeth
  the enemies of the truth: 10 propoundeth unto
  Timothy his own example, 14 and exhorteth
  him to abide in the doctrine he had learned,
  commending unto him the manifold use of the
  holy scriptures.

Chapter 4
1 Paul giveth Timothy a solemn charge to do his
  duty with all care and diligence; 6 certifieth
  him of his approaching end, and of the glorious
  prospect he had in view. 9 He desireth him
  to hasten his coming, and to bring Mark with
  him, and certain other things: 14 warneth
  him to beware of Alexander: 16 informeth
  him what had befallen him at his first apology:
  19 and concludeth with salutations, and a
  benediction.

(Titus)

Chapter 1
1 The salutation. 5 For what end Titus was
  left in Crete. 6 How they should be qualified
  who are ordained to the ministry. 10 The
  mouths of evil teachers must be stopped. 12
  The bad character of the Cretians.

Chapter 2
1 Directions given to Titus both for his doctrine
  and life. 9 The duty of servants. 11 The gospel
  teacheth all men to renounce wickedness, and to
  lead sober, righteous, and godly, lives.

Chapter 3
1 Christians are admonished to be subject to civil
  powers, and of a peaceable and quiet demeanour.
  3 They are saved from their sins by God's mercy
  through Christ, but must maintain good works.
  9 Genealogies and contentions about the law are
  to be avoided; 10 and obstinate hereticks to be
  rejected. 12 Paul appointeth Titus when and
  where to come to him; 14 recommendeth acts
  of mercy to Christians; 15 and concludeth with
  salutations and a benediction.

(Philemon)

Chapter 1
1 The salutation. 4 Paul declareth his joy in
  hearing of the love and faith of Philemon; 8
  earnestly intreating him to receive into his fa-
  vour his once fugitive servant Onesimus, now
  become a faithful Christian. 22 He desireth
  him to provide a lodging for himself, who was
  in expectation of a speedy release; 23 and con-
  cludeth with salutations and a benediction.

(Hebrews)

Chapter 1
1 The essential dignity of the Son, by whom God
  hath revealed himself in these last days: 4 his
  preeminence above the angels in office.

Chapter 2
1 The oibligation we are under to give more ear-
  nest heed to the gospel doctrine. 5 The dominion
  of the world to come was not granted to angels,
  but to the Son of man, whom it behoved to
  undergo a previous course of humiliation and
  suffering.

Chapter 3
1 Christ is shewed to be more worthy than Moses:
  7 we must be careful therefore not to follow
  the example of the obstinate and unbelieving
  Israelites in the wilderness.

Chapter 4
1 The rest of Christians to be attained by faith.
  12 The power of God's word. 14 Having
  Jesus the Son of God for our high priest, we
  must hold fast our profession, and come boldly
  unto the throne of grace.

Chapter 5
1 Concerning the office of high priests taken from
  among men: 5 wherewith Christ's priesthood is
  compared, and it's privileges set forth: 11 a
  farther account of which is deferred, and for
  what reason.

Chapter 6
1 The higher doctrines of Christianity are proposed
  to be treated of. 4 The guilt and danger of a-
  postasy. 10 Charitable deeds will not be for-
  gotten of God. 11 An exhortation diligently
  to imitate the faith and patience of those who
  inherit the promises. 13 The promise of God
  to Abraham a sure ground of hope.

Chapter 7
Christ, a priest after the order of Melchisedec, is
  proved to be of a more excellent order than that
  of Aaron, 1 from the character of Melchisedec,
  and his confessed superiority to Abraham and
  Levi; 11 from the imperfection of the Levi-
  tical priesthood, which induced the necessity of
  a change to one more perfect; 20 from the
  confirmation of Christ's priesthood by an oath;
  23 from the unchangeableness, 26 and spotless
  innocence, of the person.

Chapter 8
1 Christ, our great high priest in the heavens, hath
  a more excellent ministry than the priests on earth:
  6 as he is also the mediator of a better cove-
  nant than that which was given to Moses.

Chapter 9
1 The service and sacrifices of the first tabernacle
  were far less perfect and efficacious to purge
  the conscience than the blood of Christ. 15 The
  necessity of Christ's death for the confirmation
  of the new covenant: 23 and of better sacri-
  fices than those legal ones to purify the heavenly
  things. 25 Christ was offered once for all.

Chapter 10
1 The sacrifices of the law, being often repeated,
  could not take away sins. 5 The abolition of
  them, and substitution of Christ's body in their
  stead, fortold by the Psalmist: 10 by the of-
  fering of which body once for all we obtain
  perfect remission. 19 An exhortation to sted-
  fastness in the faith, and to love and good
  works. 26 The danger of a wilful relapse
  after having received the knowledge of the
  truth; 32 and of sorfeiting the reward of a
  good beginning for want of perserverance.

Chapter 11
The nature of faith, and it's acceptableness with
  God, set forth in the examples of many excellent
  persons of old time.

Chapter 12
1 An exhortation to patience and constancy enforced
  by the example of Christ. 5 The benefit of God's
  chastisements. 14 Exhortation to peace and
  holiness. 18 The dispensation of the law com-
  pared with the privileges of the gospel. 25 The
  danger of refusing the word from heaven.

Chapter 13
1 Exhortations to charity, 2 hospitality, 3 pity
  for the afflicted, 4 chastity, 5 contentment; 7
  to regard the preachers of God's word; 9 to
  avoid strange doctrines; 10 to confess Christ;
  15 to offer up our praises to God by him; 16 to
  do good and to communicate; 17 to obey spi-
  ritual rulers; 18 and to pray for the apostle.
  20 The epistle endeth with a prayer and sa-
  lutations.

(James)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle's address to the dispersed Jews. 2
  He recommendeth patience and joy in afflictions,
  5 and prayer with faith. 9 He giveth advice
  to the poor and to the rich. 12 The reward
  of those that are proof under trial. 13 Our
  own lusts, and not God, tempt us to sin. 17
  God is the unchangeable author of all good to
  his creatures. 19 We must receive the word
  with purity and meekness, and not only hear,
  but do it. 26 The necessity of governing the
  tongue. 27 The essential duties of true religion.

Chapter 2
1 It is not agreeable to the christian profession to
  regard the rich, and despise the poor. 10 The
  guilt of any one breach of the law. 13 The
  obligation to mercy. 14 Faith without works
  is dead. 20 We are justified, as Abraham and
  Rahab were, by works, and not by faith only.

Chapter 3
1 We must not rashly take upon ourselves to re-
  prove others. 2 The importance, difficulty, and
  duty, of governing the tongue. 13 True wis-
  dom will shew itself in meekness, peaceableness,
  and charity, in opposition to strife and envying.

Chapter 4
1 Our evil lusts and passions tend to breed quarrels
  among ourselves, and to set us at enmity with
  God. 7 The way to overcome them, and reco-
  ver God's favour. 11 Against detraction and
  censoriousness. 13 We must not presume on
  the future, but commit ourselves to God's pro-
  vidence.

Chapter 5
1 Wicked rich men are warned of God's impend-
  ing judgments. 7 The brethren are exhorted to
  patience after the example of the prophets and
  of Job: 12 to abstain from swearing; 13 to
  pray in affliction and sickness, and sing psalms
  in prosperity: 16 to acknowledge mutually their
  faults, and to pray for one another: 19 and
  to endeavour to reclaim sinners.

(1 Peter)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle's address to the strangers elect in
  Christ, dispersed throughout the lesser Asia. 3 He
  blesseth God for having raised them to the hope
  of a blessed immortality. 10 He sheweth that
  their salvation in Christ had been foretold by the
  prophets of old; 13 and exhorteth them to a
  vigilant and holy conversation, suitable to their
  calling, and redemption by the blood of Christ;
  22 and to mutual love.

Chapter 2
1 The apostle exhorteth the Christian converts to
  lay aside all uncharitableness. 4 He sheweth
  their privileges through Christ the chief corner
  stone. 11 He beseecheth them to abstain from
  fleshly lusts, and by their good conversation to
  promote God's glory among the Gentiles. 13
  He enforceth obedience to magistrates; 18 and
  teacheth servants to obey their masters, and to
  suffer patiently for well doing, after the example
  of Christ.

Chapter 3
1 The apostle teacheth the duty of wives and hus-
  bands; 8 exhorting all men to unity and love,
  and to return good for evil: 14 to suffer boldly
  for righteousness' sake, and to give a reason of
  their hope with meekness and fear; taking es-
  pecial care to suffer, as Christ did, for well-
  doing, and not for evildoing. 19 The preaching
  of Christ by his spirit to the old world. 21
  After what manner Christian baptism saveth us.

Chapter 4
1 The apostle exhorteth to cease from sin, in regard
  of Christ's having suffered for it, and of a future
  judgment. 7 From the approaching end of all
  things he urgeth to sobriety, watchfulness, and
  prayer; 8 to charity, 9 hospitality, 10 and a
  right use of spiritual gifts. 12 Sundry motives
  of comfort under persecution.

Chapter 5
1 The elders are exhorted to feed the flock of
  Christ conscientiously, looking to the chief Shep-
  herd for a reward. 5 The younger are required
  to submit to the elder, and all to practise humi-
  lity toward each other; 6 with resignation to
  God; 8 to be sober, watchful, and stedfast in
  the faith, resisting the devil. 10 The epistle is
  concluded with a prayer and benediction.

(2 Peter)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle, saluting the Christians, admonisheth
  them of the gifts and promises of the gospel, and
  their tendency to promote a godly life. 5 He
  exhorteth them to add to their faith such virtues
  as would make it fruitful; 10 and thereby to
  make their calling and election sure. 12 He is
  careful to remind them hereof, knowing his
  dissolution to be near; 16 and urgeth the evi-
  dence of what he had seen and heard in the holy
  mount in confirmation of Christ's second coming,
  together with the word of prophecy, which he
  recommendeth to their regard.

Chapter 2
1 The apostle foretelleth the appearance of false
  teachers, the impiety of them and their followers
  and the judgments that would overtake them.
  7 The godly shall be delivered, as Lot was out
  of Sodom. 10 The wicked principles and man-
  ners of these seducers described. 20 The mis-
  chief of relapsing into sin.

Chapter 3
1 The apostle declareth it to be the design of both
  his epistles to remind the brethren of Christ's
  coming to judgment, in opposition to scoffers.
  8 No argument can be drawn against it from
  the delay, which is designed to leave men room
  for repentance. 10 He describeth the day
  of the Lord, and exhorteth to holiness of life in
  expectation of it. 15 He sheweth that Paul
  had taught the like in his epistles: 17 and con-
  cludeth with advice to beware of seduction, and
  to grow in christian grace and knowledge.

(1 John)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle professeth to declare what he had
  formerly seen and known of the Word of life, to
  the end that others might have fellowship with
  him. 5 The substance of his doctrine is, That
  to have fellowship with God, we must be holy as
  he is holy; and that if we confess our sins, we
  shall be forgiven through the blood of Christ.

Chapter 2
1 Christ is our advocate with the Father, and a
  propitiation for the sins of the whole world.
  3 Rightly to know God is to keep his command-
  ments: 7 the chief of which is to love one ano-
  ther. 12 The apostle addresseth Christians of
  all ages severally, 15 and warneth them a-
  gainst an inordinate love of this world: 18 He
  sheweth the means they had of knowing the
  truth, and of distinguishing false teachers; and
  pointeth out their obligation to abide in the
  truth which they had been taught. 29 He that
  doeth righteousness is born of God.

Chapter 3
1 It is a mark of God's singular love toward us,
  that we are now called his sons, and designed
  for farther happiness hereafter: 3 and therefore
  we must obediently keep his commandments, 11
  and love one another with true brotherly kind-
  ness and actual beneficence.

Chapter 4
1 The apostle warneth to try by certain rules the
  spirits that pretend to come from God. 7 He
  presseth the obligation of mutual love upon
  Christians from the example and commandment
  of God.

Chapter 5
1 He that loveth God loveth God's children, and
  keepeth his commandments. 4 A true faith will
  enable us to overcome the world. 6 The wit-
  nesses of our faith. 11 God hath given to be-
  lievers eternal life through his Son: 14 and
  will hear and grant their petitions made accord-
  ing to his will. 18 God's children are distin-
  guished from the world by abstaining from sin,
  and by a right knowledge. 21 A caution
  against idolatry.

(2 John)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle testifieth his regard and good wishes
  for a certain pious matron and her children,
  and his joy in their good behaviour: 5 he ex-
  horteth them to persevere in Christian love and
  belief, that they lose not their full reward:
  10 and to have nothing to do with those seducers
  that bring not the true doctrine of Christ. 12
  He hopeth to see them shortly, and concludeth
  with salutations.

(3 John)

Chapter 1
1 The apostle, after a kind salutation to Gaius,
  testifieth his joy in his piety, 5 commending his
  hispitality toward the preachers of the gospel.
  9 He censureth Diotrephes, and threateneth
  him for his ambitious opposition. 11 The ill
  example of such is not to be followed. 12 He
  beareth testimony to the good character of De-
  metrius. 13 He hopeth to see Gaius shortly,
  and concludeth with salutations.

(Jude)

Chapter 1
1 After a general address, Jude exhorteth Christians
  to constancy in the received faith. 4 He fore-
  telleth the punishment of certain false teachers
  crept into the church, and describeth their evil
  doctrine and manners. 20 He exhorteth true
  Christians to persevere in the right faith, and
  in the love of God; 22 and to seek the refor-
  mation of others. 24 He concludeth with a-
  scribing glory to God.

  compassed with four and twenty elders, 6 and four
  beasts full of eyes before and behind. 8 The con-
  tinual adoration and worship offered by the beasts
  and elders before him that sat on the throne.

Chapter 5
1 The book sealed with seven seals, which no man
  is worthy to open. 4 John weeping thereat is
  comforted. 6 The Lamb that was slain taketh
  the book to open it. 8 The beasts and the elders
  praise him that had redeemed them with his
  blood. 11 The angels join with them in ascrib-
  ing glory to God and to the Lamb.

  them that were sealed out of each of the tribes
  of Israel 9 An innumerable multitude out of
  all other nations stand before the throne in white
  robes, with palms in their hands, praising God
  and the Lamb. 11 The angels, elders, and
  beasts, worship and glorify God. 13 One of
  the elders sheweth John who they are that are
  clad in white robes, and what is their blessed-
  ness for ever.

Chapter 8
1 The seventh seal opened. 2 Seven angels receive
  seven trumpets. 3 An angel presenteth the
  prayers of the saints with incense on the golden
  altar before the throne. 6 Four of the angels
  sound their trumpets, and great plagues severally
  follow.

Chapter 9
1 At the sounding of the fifth angel a star falleth
  from heaven, to whom is given the key of the
  bottomless pit: 2 he opens the pit, and there
  come forth locusts like scorpions, who have power
  to hurt men for a time. 12 The first woe past.
  13 At the sounding of the sixth angel four angels
  which were bound are loosed, and bring great
  plagues on the earth for a limited time.

Chapter 10
1 A mighty angel appeareth with a book open in
  his hand; 5 and sweareth by him that liveth
  for ever, that there shall be no more time. 8
  John is commanded to take and eat the book,
  and to prophesy.

Chapter 11
1 John is commanded to measure the temple, all
  but the outer court. 3 The two witnesses that
  shall prophesy: 5 their power: 7 the beast
  shall fight against them, and kill them: 8 they
  shall lie unburied three days and a half, 11 and
  then rise again, and ascend into heaven. 13 A
  great earthquake. 14 The second woe past. 15

  angels. 10 the victory proclaimed in heaven.
  13 The dragon cast down to the earth perse-
  cuteth the woman.

Chapter 13
1 A beast with seven heads and ten horns riseth
  out of the sea, to whom the dragon giveth his
  power, wherewith he blasphemeth God, and
  vexeth the saints. 11 Another beast cometh
  up out of the earth, which supporteth the
  worship of the former beast. 18 The number
  of the beast.

Chapter 14
1 The Lamb with his company standing on mount
  Sion: 6 an angel preacheth the gospel; 8 ano-
  ther proclaimeth the fall of Babylon; 9 and a
  third the punishment of them that worship the
  beast. 13 The blessedness of those that die in
  the Lord. 14 The harvest of the world. 17
  The vintage and winepress of God's wrath.

  the scarlet coloured beast, arrayed in purple
  and scarlet, with a golden cup in her hand. 5

  saints. 7 The interpretation of the mystery of
  the beast, and of his seven heads and ten
  horns; 18 and of the woman.

Chapter 18

  4 God's people commanded to depart out of her.
  8 Her judgment. 9 The kings of the earth, 11
  and the merchants, 17 and mariners, lament
  over her. 20 The saints are excited to rejoice
  over her. 21 A milstone cast into the sea de-
  noteth her irrecoverable fall.

Chapter 19
1 God is praised in heaven for judging the great
  whore, and avenging the blood of his saints.
  6 The triumph because of the marriage of the
  Lamb. 10 The angel, who shewed John these
  things, refuseth to be worshipped. 11 The vi-
  sion of the Word of God sitting upon a white
  horse, and followed by his armies. 17 The
  fowls called to feast on the flesh of those that
  took part with the beast. 20 The beast and
  false prophet cast into the lake of fire and brim-
  stone; and the rest slain.

Chapter 20
1 Satan bound for a thousand years. 4 The first
  resurrection. 7 Satan again let loose gathereth
  Gog and Magog to battle, who are devoured
  with fire. 10 The devil cast into the lake of

  tion of the heavenly Jerusalem.

  of the servants of God. 8 John is forbidden by
  the angel to worship him; 10 and commanded
  to seal up the prophecy. 12 Christ's coming
  and eternity. 14 The blessedness of them that
  do God's commandments. 18 Nothing must
  be added to or taken from this prophecy. 21
  The concluding benediction.
