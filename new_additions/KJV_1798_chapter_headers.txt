  tivated Hebrews, and the hidden Israelites, join
  against them. 24 Saul's unadvised adjuration
  hindereth the victory: 32 he restraineth the peo-
  ple from eating blood: 35 he buildeth an altar.
  36 Jonathan taken by lot, is saved by the people.

  Hadoram, and make Rehoboam to flee.

Chapter 11
1 Rehoboam raising an army to subdue Israel, is

  a solemn covenant with God: 16 he putteth down
  Maachah his mother for her idolatry: 18 he
  bringeth dedicated things into the house of God,
  and enjoyeth a long peace.

Chapter 16
1 Asa, by the aid of the Syrians, diverteth Baasha
  from building of Ramah. 7 Being reproved
  thereof by Hanani, he putteth him in prison.
  11 Among his other acts, in his disease he seeketh

  and burial.

Chapter 17

  prospereth: 7 he sendeth Levites with the princes
  to teach Judah: 10 his enemies being terrified
  by God, some of them bring him presents and
  tribute: 12 his greatness, captains, and armies.

  suaded to go with him against Ramoth-gilead.

  of Israelites against the Edomites, at the word of
  a prophet he loseth the hundred talents, and dis-
  misseth them: 11 he overthroweth the Edomites.
  10, 13 The Israelites discontented with their dis-
  mission, spoil as they return home. 14 Amaziah,
  proud of his victory, serveth the gods of Edom,
  and despiseth the admonitions of the prophet:
  17 he provoketh Joash to his overthrow: 25 his
  reign: 27 he is slain by conspiracy.

Chapter 26
1 Uzziah succeeding, and reigning well in the days
  of Zechariah, prospereth: 16 waxing proud, he

  the Amorites: 7 his reign: 9 Ahaz succeedeth

  by the Syrians. 6 Judah being captivated by
  the Israelites, is sent home by the counsel of
  Oded the prophet. 16 Ahaz sending for aid to
  Assyria, is not helped thereby: 22 in his distress
  he groweth more idolatrous: 26 he dying, He-
  zekiah succeedeth him.

Chapter 32
1 Sennacherib invading Judah, Hezekiah fortifieth
  himself, and encourageth his people. 9 Against
  the blasphemies of Sennacherib by message and
  letters, Hezekiah and Isaiah pray. 21 An
  angel destroyeth the host of the Assyrians, to the
  glory of Hezekiah. 24 Hezekiah praying in his
  sickness, God giveth him a sign of recovery: 25
  he waxing proud, is humbled by God: 27 his
  wealth and works: 31 his error in the embassage
  of Babylon: 32 he dying, Manasseh succeedeth
  him.

Chapter 33
1 Manasseh his wicked reign: 3 he setteth up
  idolatry, and will not be admonished: 11 he
  is carried into Babylon. 12 Upon his prayer to
  God he is released, and putteth down idolatry:
  18 his acts: 20 he dying, Amon succeedeth
  him. 21 Amon reigning wickedly, is slain by his
  servants. 25 The murderers being slain, Josiah
  succeedeth him.

Chapter 34
1 Josiah's good reign: 3 he destroyeth idolatry:
  8 he taketh order for the repair of the temple.
  14 Hilkiah having found a book of the law,
  Josiah sendeth to Huldah to enquire of the Lord.
  23 Huldah prophesieth the destruction of Jeru-
  salem, but respite thereof in Josiah's time. 29
  Josiah causing it to be read in a solemn assembly,
  reneweth the covenant with God.

  provoking Pharaoh-necho, is slain at Megiddo.
  25 Lamentations for Josiah.

1 Jehoahaz succeeding, is deposed by Pharaoh, and
  carried into Egypt. 5 Jehoiakim reigning ill,
  is carried bound into Babylon. 9 Jehoiachin
  succeeding, reigneth ill, and is brought into Ba-
  bylon. 11 Zedekiah succeeding, reigneth ill, and
  despiseth the prophets, and rebelleth against Ne-
  buchadnezzar. 14 Jerusalem, for the sins of

  counsel of Memucan, maketh the decree of men's
  sovereignty.

Chapter 2
1 Out of a choice of virgins a queen is to be
  chosen. 5 Mordecai the nursing father of Esther.
  8 Esther is preferred by Hegai before the rest.
  12 The manner of purification, and going in to
  the king. 15 Esther, best pleasing the king, is
  made queen. 21 Mordecai, discovering a trea-
  son, is recorded in the chronicles.

Chapter 3
1 Haman, advanced by the king, and despised by
  Mordecai, seeketh revenge upon all the Jews:
  7 he casteth lots: 8 he obtaineth, by calumnia-
  tion, a decree of the king to put the Jews to
  death.

Chapter 4
1 The great mourning of Mordecai and the Jews:
  4 Esther understanding it, sendeth to Mordecai,
  who sheweth the cause, and adviseth her to un-
  dertake the suit: 10 she excusing herself, is
  threatened by Mordecai: 15 she appointing a
  fast, undertaketh the suit.

Chapter 5
1 Esther adventuring on the king's favour, obtain-
  eth the grace of the golden sceptre, and inviteth
  the king and Haman to a banquet. 6 She being
  encouraged by the king in her suit, inviteth them
  to another banquet the next day. 9 Haman
  proud of his advancement, repineth at the con-
  tempt of Mordecai. 14 By the counsel of Zeresh,
  he buildeth for him a gallows.

Chapter 6
1 Ahasuerus reading in the chronicles of the good
  service done by Mordecai, taketh care for his
  reward. 4 Haman coming to sue that Mor-
  decia might be hanged, unawares giveth coun-
  sel that he might do him honour. 12 Complain-
  ing of his misfortune, his friends tell him of his
  final destiny.

Chapter 7
1 Esther entertaining the king and Haman, mak-
  eth suit for her own life and her people's: 5 she
  accuseth Haman. 7 The king in his anger under-
  standing of the gallows which Haman had made

  advancement under him.

(Job)

Chapter 1
1 The holiness, riches, and religious care of Job for
  his children. 6 Satan appearing before God, by
  calumniation obtaineth leave to tempt Job. 13
  Understanding of the loss of his goods and chil-
  dren, in his mourning he blesseth God.

Chapter 2
1 Satan appearing again before God, obtaineth
  further leave to tempt Job: he smiteth him
  with sore boils: 9 Job reproveth his wife, mov-
  ing him to curse God: 11 his three friends con-
  dole with him in silence.

Chapter 3
1 Job curseth the day and services of his birth.
  13 The ease of death: 20 he complaineth of
  life, because of his anguish.

Chapter 4
1 Eliphaz reproveth Job for want of religion:
  7 he teacheth God's judgements to be not for the
  righteous, but for the wicked: 12 his fearful
  vision, to humble the excellencies of creatures
  before God.

Chapter 5
1 The harm of inconsideration. 3 The end of the
  wicked is misery. 6 God is to be regarded in
  affliction. 17 The happy end of God's correction.

Chapter 6
1 Job sheweth that his complaints are not cause-
  less: 8 he wisheth for death, wherein he is
  assured of comfort: 14 he reproveth his friends
  of unkindness.

Chapter 7
1 Job execuseth his desire of death: 12 he com-
  plaineth of his own restlessness, and God's
  watchfulness.

Chapter 8
1 Bildad sheweth God's justice in dealing with
  men according to their works: 8 he alledgeth
  antiquity to prove the certain destruction of the
  hypocrite: 20 he applyeth God's just dealing to
  Job.

Chapter 9
1 Job acknowledgeth God's justice, sheweth there
  is no contending with him. 22 Man's innocency
  is not to be condemned by afflictions.

Chapter 10
1 Job taking liberty of complaint, expostulateth
  with God about his afflictions: 18 he complain-
  eth of life, and craveth a little ease before death.

Chapter 11
1 Zophar reproveth Job for justifying himself.
  6 God's wisdom is unsearchable. 13 The assured
  blessing of repentance.

Chapter 12
1 Job maintaineth himself against his friends that
  reprove him: 7 he acknowledgeth the general
  doctrine of God's omnipotency.

Chapter 13
1 Job reproveth his friends of partiality: 14 he
  professeth his confidence in God, 20 and intreat-
  eth to know his own sins, and God's purpose in
  afflicting him.

Chapter 14
1 Job intreateth God for favour, by the shortness
  of life, and certainty of death. 7 Though life
  once lost be irrecoverable, yet he waiteth for his
  change. 16 By sin the creature is subject to
  corruption.

Chapter 15
1 Eliphaz reproveth Job of impiety in justifying
  himself: 17 he proveth by tradition the unquietness
  of wicked men.

Chapter 16
1 Job reproveth his friends of unmercifulness: 7
  he sheweth the pitifulness of his case: 17 he
  maintaineth his innocence.

Chapter 17
1 Job appealeth from men to God. 6 The unmer-
  ciful dealing of men with the afflicted, may asto-
  nish, but not discourage the righteous. 11 His
  hope is not in life, but in death.

Chapter 18
1 Bildad reproveth Job of presumption and impa-
  tience. 5 The calamities of the wicked.

Chapter 19
1 Job complaining of his friends' cruelty, sheweth
  there is misery enough in him to feed their cruelty:
  21, 28 he craveth pity: 25 he believeth the
  resurrection.

Chapter 20
Zophar sheweth the state and portion of the wicked.

Chapter 21
1 Job sheweth that even in the judgement of man
  he hath reason to be grieved. 7 Sometimes the
  wicked do so prosper, as they despise God. 16
  Sometimes their destruction is manifest. 23 The
  happy and unhpapy are alike in death. 27 The
  judgement of the wicked is in another world.

Chapter 22
1 Eliphaz sheweth that man's goodness profiteth
  not God: 5 he accuseth Job of divers sins: 21
  he exhorteth him to repentance, with promises of
  mercy.

Chapter 23
1 Job longeth to appear before God, 6 in con-
  fidence of his mercy. 8 God, who is invisible,
  observeth our ways. 11 Job's innocence. 13 God's
  decree is immutable.

Chapter 24
1 Wickedness goeth often unpunished. 17 There is
  a secret judgement for the wicked.

Chapter 25
Bildad sheweth that man cannot be justified
  before God.

Chapter 26
1 Job reproving the uncharitable spirit of Bildad,
  5 acknowledgeth the power of God to be infinite
  and unsearchable.

Chapter 27
1 Job protesteth his sincerity. 8 The hypocrite is
  without hope. 11 The blessings which the wicked
  have are turned into curses.

Chapter 28
1 There is a knowledge of natural things: 12 but
  wisdom is an excellent gift of God.

Chapter 29
Job bemoaneth himself of his former prosperity
  and honour.

Chapter 30
1 Job's honour is turned into extreme contempt;
  15 his prosperity into calamity.

Chapter 31
Job maketh a solemn protestation of his integrity in
  several duties.

Chapter 32
1 Elihu is angry with Job and his three friends.
  6 Beause wisdom cometh not from age, he ex-
  cuseth the boldness of his youth: 11 he reproveth
  them for not satisfying of Job: 16 his zeal to
  speak.

Chapter 33
1 Elihu offereth himself instead of God, with sin-
  cerity and meekness, to reason with Job: 8 he
  excuseth God from giving man an account of his
  ways, by his greatness. 14 God calleth man to
  repentance by visions, 19 by afflictions, 23 and
  by his ministry: 31 he inciteth Job to attention.

Chapter 34
1 Elihu accuseth Job for charging God with in-
  justice. 10 God omnipotent cannot be unjust. 31
  Man must humble himself unto God. 34 Elihu
  reproveth Job.

Chapter 35
1 Comparison is not to be made with God, because
  our good or evil cannot extend unto him. 9 Many
  cry in their afflictions, but are not heard for
  want of faith.

Chapter 36
1 Elihu sheweth how God is just in his ways. 16
  How Job's sins hinder God's blessings. 24 God's
  works are to be magnified.

Chapter 37
1 God is to be feared because of his great works:
  15 his wisdom is unsearchable in them.

Chapter 38
1 God challengeth Job to answer. 4 God by his
  mighty works convinceth Job of ignorance, 31
  and of imbecility.

Chapter 39
1 Of the wild goats and hinds. 5 Of the wild
  ass, 9 the unicorn, 13 the peacock, stork, and
  ostrich, 19 the horse, 26 the hawk, 27 the
  eagle.

Chapter 40
3 Job humbleth himself to God. 6 God stirreth
  him up to shew his righteousness, power, and
  wisdom. 15 Of the behemoth.

Chapter 41
Of God's great power in the leviathan.

Chapter 42
1 Job submitteth himself unto God. 7 God pre-
  ferring Job's cause, maketh his friends submit
  themselves, and accepteth him: 10 he magnifieth
  and blesseth Job. 16 Job's age and death.

  17 God encourageth him with his promise of
  assistance.

  exhorteth to mourn for their abominations in
  Tophet, 32 and the judgements for the same.

  ments: 22 he sheweth that their abominations
  are the cause thereof.

Chapter 14

  marriage, from houses of mourning and feasting,

  their deliverance out of Egypt. 16 God will
  doubly recompense their idolatry.

  Ahikam.

  the subduing of the neighbour kings unto Nebu-
  chadnezzar: 8 he exhorteth them to yield, and

  remnant of the vessels shall be carried to Baby-
  lon, and there continue until the day of visitation.

Chapter 28
1 Hananiah prophesieth falsely the return of the
  vessels, and of Jeconiah. 5 Jeremiah wishing it to
  be true, sheweth that the event will declare who
  are true prophets. 10 Hananiah breaketh Je-
  remiah's yoke. 12 Jeremiah telleth of an iron
  yoke, 15 and foretelleth Hananiah's death.

Chapter 29
1 Jeremiah sendeth a letter to the captives in Ba-
  bylon, to be quiet there, 8 and not to believe
  the dreams of their prophets, 10 and that they
  shall return with grace after seventy years:

  their disobedience: 20 he sheweth the fearful
  end of Ahab and Zedekiah, two lying prophets.

  30 Jeremiah readeth his doom.

  prophecy, 6 buyeth Hanameel's field. 13 Baruch
  must preserve the evidences, as tokens of the
  people's return. 16 Jeremiah in his prayer com-
  plaineth to God. 26 God confirmeth the capti-
  vity for their sins, 36 and promiseth a gracious
  return.

Chapter 33
1 God promiseth to the captivity a gracious return,
  9 a joyful state, 12 a settled government, 15
  Christ, the Branch of righteousness, 17 a conti-
  nuance of kingdom and priesthood, 20 and a

Chapter 34
1 Jeremiah prophesieth the captivity of Zedekiah
  and the city. 8 The princes and the people hav-

  for their disobediance, giveth them and Zedekiah
  into the hands of their enemies.

  denounceth his judgement. 32 Baruch writeth a
  new copy.

1 Malachi complaineth of Israel's unkindness, 6 of
  their irreligion, 12 and profaneness.

Chapter 2
1 He sharply reproveth the priests for neglecting
  their covenant; 11 and the people for idolatry,
  14 for adultery, 17 and for infidelity.

Chapter 3
1 Of the messenger, majesty, and grace of Christ.
  7 Of the rebellion, 8 sacrilege, 13 and infide-
  lity of the people. 16 The promise of blessing to
  them that fear God.

Chapter 4
1 God's judgement on the wicked, 2 and his blessing
  on the good: 4 he exhorteth to the study of
  the law, 5 and telleth of Elijah's coming and
  office.

[Apocrypha]

(1 Esdras)

Chapter 1
1 Josias his charge to the priests and Levites.
  7 A great passover is kept: 32 his death is
  much lamented: 34 his successors. 53 The
  temple, city, and people are destroyed. 56 The
  rest are carried unto Babylon.

Chapter 2
1 Cyrus is moved by God to build the temple, 5 and
  giveth leave to the Jews to return and contri-
  bute to it: 11 he delivereth again the vessels
  which had been taken thence. 25 Artaxerxes
  forbiddeth the Jews to build any more.

Chapter 3
4 Three strive to excel each other is wise speeches.
  9 They refer themselves to the judgement of the
  king. 18 The first declareth the strength of
  wine.

Chapter 4
1 The second declareth the power of a king. 13
  The third the force of women, 33 and of truth.
  41 The third is judged to be wisest, 47 and
  obtaineth letters of the king to build Jerusalem:
  58 he praiseth God, and sheweth his brethren
  what he had done.

Chapter 5
4 The names and number of the Jews that re-
  turned home. 50 The altar is set up in his
  place. 57 The foundation of the temple is laid.
  73 The work is hindered for a time.

Chapter 6
1 The prophets stir up the people to build the tem-
  ple. 8 Darius is solicited to hinder it. 27 But
  he doth further it by all means, 32 and threat-
  eneth those that shall hinder it.

Chapter 7
1 Sisinnes and others help forward the bilding:
  5 the temple is finished, and dedicated. 10 The
  passover is kept.

Chapter 8
1 Esdras bringeth the king's commission to build:
  8 the copy of it: 28 he declareth the names and
  number of those that came with him, 61 and his
  journey: 71 he lamenteth the sins of his people,
  96 and sweareth the priests to put away their
  strange wives.

Chapter 9
1 Esdras assembleth all the people. 10 They
  promise to put away the strange wives. 20 The
  names and number of them that did so. 40 The
  law of Moses is read and declared before all the
  people. 49 They weep, and are put in mind of
  the feast day.

(2 Esdras)

Chapter 1
1 Esdras is commanded to reprove the people. 24
  God threateneth to cast them off, 35 and to give
  their houses to a people of more grace than they.

Chapter 2
1 God complaineth of his people: 10 yet Esdras
  is willed to comfort them. 34 Because they
  refused, the Gentiles are called. 43 Esdras
  seeth the Son of God, and those that are crowned
  by him.

Chapter 3
1 Esdras is troubled, 13 and acknowledgeth the
  sins of the people: 28 yet complaineth that the
  heathen were lords over them, being more wicked
  than they.

Chapter 4
1 The angel declareth the ignorance of Esdras in
  God's judgements, 13 and adviseth him not to
  meddle with things above his reach. 23 Ne-
  vertheless, Esdras asketh divers questions, and
  receiveth answers to them.

Chapter 5
1 The signs of times to come. 23 He asketh why
  God, choosing but one people, did cast them off:
  30 he is taught that God's judgements are
  unsearchable, 46 and that God doeth not all at
  once.

Chapter 6
1 God's purpose is eternal. 9 The next world shall
  follow this immediately. 13 What shall fall out
  at the last. 31 He is promised more knowledge,
  38 and reckoneth up the works of the creation,
  57 and complaineth that they have no part in
  the world for whom it was made.

Chapter 7
4 The way is narrow. 12 When it was made
  narrow. 28 All shall die, and rise again. 33
  Christ shall sit in judgement. 46 God hath not
  made paradise in vain; 62 he is merciful.

Chapter 8
1 Many created, but few saved. 6 He asketh
  why God destroyeth his own work, 26 and
  prayeth God to look upon the people which only
  serve him. 41 God answereth, that all seed
  cometh not to good, 52 and that glory is pre-
  pared for him and such like.

Chapter 9
7 Who shall be saved, and who not. 19 All the
  world is now corrupted; 22 yet God doth save
  a few: 33 he complaineth that those perish
  which keep God's law: 38 and seeth a woman
  lamenting in a field.

Chapter 10
6 He comforteth the woman in the field: 27 she
  vanisheth away, and a city appeareth in her
  place. 40 The angel declareth these visions in
  the field.

Chapter 11
1 He seeth in his dream an eagle coming out of
  the sea, 37 and a lion out of a wood talking to
  the eagle.

Chapter 12
1 The eagle which he saw is destroyed. 10 The
  vision is interpreted: 37 he is bid to write his
  visions, 39 and to fast, that he may see more:
  46 he doth comfort those that were grieved for
  his absence.

Chapter 13
1 He seeth in his dream a man coming out of the
  sea. 25 The declaration of his dream: 54 he
  is praised, and promised to see more.

Chapter 14
1 A voice out of the bush calleth Esdras, 10 and
  telleth him that the world waxeth old: 22 he
  desireth, because the law was burnt, to write all
  again, 24 and is bid to get swift writers: 39
  he and they are filled with understanding. 45
  But he is charged not to publish all that is
  written.

Chapter 15
1 This prophecy is certain. 5 God will take ven-
  geance upon the wicked, 12 upon Egypt. 28
  An horrible vision. 43 Babylon and Asia are
  threatened.

Chapter 16
1 Babylon and other places are threatened with
  plagues that cannot be avoided, 23 and with
  desolation. 40 The servants of the Lord must
  look for troubles: 51 and not hide their sins,
  74 but leave them, and they shall be delivered.

(Tobit)

Chapter 1
1 Tobit his stock and devotion in his youth: 9 his
  marriage, 10 and captivity: 13 his preferment,
  16 alms, and charity in burying the dead, 19
  for which he is accused, and fleeth, 22 and
  after returneth to Nineve.

Chapter 2
1 Tobit leaveth his meat to bury the dead, 10 and
  becometh blind: 11 his wife taketh in work to
  get her living: 14 her husband and she fall out
  about a kid.

Chapter 3
1 Tobit grieved with his wife's taunts, prayeth.
  11 Sara reproached by her father's maids,
  prayeth also. 17 An angel is sent to help them
  both.

Chapter 4
3 Tobit giveth instructions to his son Tobias,
  20 and telleth him of money left with Gabael in
  Media.

Chapter 5
4 Young Tobias seeketh a guide into Media. 6
  The angel will go with him, 12 and saith he is
  his kinsman. 16 Tobias and the angel depart
  together: 17 but his mother is grieved for her
  son's departing.

Chapter 6
4 The angel biddeth Tobias to take the liver, heart,
  and gall out of a fish, 10 and to marry Sara the
  daughter of Raguel: 16 and teacheth how to
  drive the wicked spirit away.

Chapter 7
11 Raguel telleth Tobias what had happened to
  his daughter: 12 and giveth her in marriage
  unto him: 17 she is conveyed to her chamber,
  and weepeth: 18 her mother comforteth her.

Chapter 8
3 Tobias driveth the wicked spirit away, as he
  was taught: 4 he and his wife rise up to pray.
  10 Raguel thought he was dead; 15 but find-
  ing him alive, praiseth God, 19 and maketh a
  wedding feast.

Chapter 9
1 Tobias sendeth the angel unto Gabael for the
  money. 6 The angel bringeth it and Gabael to
  the wedding.

Chapter 10
1 Tobit and his wife long for their son. 7 She
  will not be comforted by her husband. 10 Raguel
  sendeth Tobias and his wife away with half
  their goods, 12 and blesseth them.

Chapter 11
5 Tobias' mother spieth her son coming: 10 his
  father meeteth him at the door, and recovereth
  his sight: 14 he praiseth God, 17 and wel-
  cometh his daughter in law.

Chapter 12
5 Tobit offereth half to the angel for his pains.
  6 But he calleth them both aside, and exhorteth
  them, 15 and telleth them that he was an angel,
  21 and was seen no more.

Chapter 13
The thanksgiving unto God, which Tobit wrote.

Chapter 14
3 Tobit giveth instructions to his son, 8 specially
  to leave Nineve: 11 he and his wife die, and
  are buried. 12 Tobias removeth to Ecbatane,
  14 and there died, after he had heard of the
  destruction of Nineve.

(Judith)

Chapter 1
2 Arphaxad fortifieth Ecbatane, 5 Nabuchodonosor
  maketh war against him, 7 and craveth aid: 12
  he threateneth those that would not aid him, 15 and
  killeth Arphaxad, 16 and returneth to Nineve.

Chapter 2
4 Holofernes is appointed general, 11 and charged
  to spare none that will not yield: 15 his army
  and provision: 23 the places which he won and
  wasted as he went.

Chapter 3
1 They of the sea coasts intreat for peace. 7 Holo-
  fernes is received there: 8 yet he destroyeth their
  gods, that they might worship only Nabuchodo-
  nosor: 9 he cometh near to Judea.

Chapter 4
1 The Jews are afraid of Holofernes 5 and fortify
  the hills. 6 They of Bethulia take charge of the
  passages. 9 All Israel fall to fasting and prayer.

Chapter 5
5 Achor telleth Holofernes what the Jews are, 8
  and what their God had done for them: 21 and
  adviseth not to meddle with them. 22 All that
  heard him were offended at him.

Chapter 6
1 Holofernes despiseth God: 7 he threateneth
  Achior, and sendeth him away. 14 The Be-
  thulians receive and hear him: 18 They fall to
  prayer, and comfort Achior.

Chapter 7
1 Holofernes besiegeth Bethulia, 7 and stoppeth the
  water from them. 22 They faint, and murmur
  against the governors, 30 who promise to yield
  within five days.

Chapter 8
1 The state and behaviour of Judith a widow:
  12 she blameth the governors for their pro-
  mise to yield, 17 and adviseth them to trust in
  God. 21 They excuse their promise: 32 she
  promiseth to do something for them.

Chapter 9
1 Judith humbleth herself, 2 and prayeth God to
  prosper her purpose against the enemies of his
  sanctuary.

Chapter 10
3 Judith doth set forth herself: 10 she and her
  maid go forth into the camp: 17 the watch
  take and conduct her to Holofernes.

Chapter 11
1 Holofernes asketh Judith the cause of her com-
  ing; she telleth him how and when he may
  prevail; 20 he is much pleased with her wisdom
  and beauty.

Chapter 12
2 Judith will not eat of Holofernes' meat: 7 she
  tarrieth three days in the camp, and every night
  went forth to pray. 13 Bagoas moveth her to
  be merry with Holofernes, 20 who for joy of
  her company drank much.

Chapter 13
2 Judith is left alone with Holofernes in his tent:
  4 she prayeth God to give her strength: 7 she
  cut off his head while he slept, 10 and returned
  with it to Bethulia: 17 they saw it, and com-
  mend her.

Chapter 14
1 Achior heareth Judith tell what she had done,
  and is circumcised. 11 The head of Holofernes
  is hanged up. 15 Holofernes is found dead, and
  much lamented by the Assyrians.

Chapter 15
1 The Assyrians are chased and slain. 8 The high
  priest cometh to see Judith. 11 The stuff of
  Holofernes is given to Judith. 13 The women
  crown her with a garland.

Chapter 16
1 The song of Judith. 19 She dedicateth the stuff
  of Holofernes. 23 She died at Bethulia, a
  widow of great honor. 24 All Israel did
  lament her death.

(Esther (Greek))

Chapter 10
Mardocheus remembereth and expoundeth his dream
  of the river and the two dragons.

Chapter 11
2 The stock and quality of Mardocheus: 6 he
  dreameth of two dragons coming forth to fight,
  10 and of a little fountain which became a
  great water.

Chapter 12
2 The conspiracy of the two eunuchs is discovered
  by Mardocheus, 5 for which he is entertained
  by the king, and rewarded.

Chapter 13
1 The copy of the king's letters to destroy the Jews:
  8 the prayer of Mardocheus for them.

Chapter 14
The prayer of queen Esther for herself and her
  people.

Chapter 15
6 Esther cometh into the king's presence: 7 he
  looketh angrily, and she fainteth. 8 The king
  doth take her up and comfort her.

Chapter 16
1 The letter of Artaxerxes, 10 wherein he taxeth
  Aman, 17 and revoketh the decree procured by
  Aman to destroy the Jews, 22 and commandeth
  the day of their deliverance to be kept holy.

(Wisdom)

Chapter 1
2 To whom God sheweth himself, 4 and wisdom
  herself. 6 An evil speaker cannot lie hid. 12
  We procure our own destruction: 13 for God
  created not death.

Chapter 2
1 The wicked think this life short, 5 and of no
  other after this. 6 Therefore they will take their
  pleasure in this, 10 and conspire against the
  just. 21 What that is which doth blind them.

Chapter 3
1 The godly are happy in their death. 5 and in
  their troubles: 10 the wicked are not, nor their
  children: 13 but they that are pure, are happy,
  though they have no children: 16 for the adul-
  terer and his seed shall perish.

Chapter 4
1 The chaste man shall be crowned. 3 Bastard slips
  shall not thrive: 6 they shall witness against
  their parents. 7 The just die young, and are
  happy. 19 The miserable end of the wicked.

Chapter 5
1 The wicked shall wonder at the godly, 4 and
  confess their error, 5 and the vanity of their
  lives. 15 God will reward the just, 17 and
  war against the wicked.

Chapter 6
1 Kings must give ear. 3 They have their power
  from God, 5 who will not spare them. 12 Wis-
  dom is soon found. 21 Princes must seek for it:
  24 for a wise prince is the stay of his people.

Chapter 7
1 All men have their beginning and end alike:
  8 he preferred wisdom before all things else.
  15 God gave him all the knowledge which he
  had. 22 The praise of wisdom.

Chapter 8
2 He is in love with wisdom: 4 for he that
  hath it, hath every good thing. 21 It cannot
  be had but from God.

Chapter 9
1 A prayer unto God for his wisdom, 6 without
  which the best man is nothing worth, 13 neither
  can he tell how to please God.

Chapter 10
1 What wisdom did for Adam, 4 Noe, 5 Abra-
  ham, 6 Lot, and against the five cities, 10
  for Jacob, 13 Joseph, 16 Moses, 17 and the
  Israelites.

Chapter 11
5 The Egyptians were punished, and the Israelites
  reserved in the same thing.  15 They were
  plagued by the same things wherein they sinned.
  20 God could have destroyed them otherwise,
  23 but he is merciful to all.

Chapter 12
2 God did not destroy those of Canaan all at once:
  12 if he had done so, who could controul him?
  19 But by sparing them he taught us. 27 They
  were punished with their gods.

Chapter 13
1 They were not excused that worshipped any of
  God's works. 10 But most wretched are they
  that worship the work of men's hands.

Chapter 14
1 Though men do not pray to their ships, 5 yet
  are they saved rather by them than by their
  idols. 8 Idols are accursed, and so are the
  makers of them. 14 The beginning of idolatry,
  23 and the effects thereof. 30 God will punish
  them that swear falsely by their idols.

Chapter 15
1 We do acknowledge the true God. 6 The folly of
  idol makers, 14 and of the enemies of God's
  people: 15 because, besides the idols of the Gen-
  tiles, 18 they worshipped vile beasts.

Chapter 16
2 God gave strange meat to his people, to stir up
  their appetite, and vile beasts to their enemies,
  to take it from them: 5 he stung them with
  his serpents, 12 but soon healed them by his
  word only. 17 The creatures altered their na-
  ture to pleasure God's people, and to offend their
  enemies.

Chapter 17
1 Why the Egyptians were punished with darkness.
  4 The terrors of that darkness. 11 The terrors
  of an ill conscience.

Chapter 18
4 Why Egypt was punished with darkness, 5 and
  with the death of their children. 18 They
  themselves saw the cause thereof. 20 God also
  plagued his own people. 21 By what means
  that plague was stayed.

Chapter 19
1 Why God sheweth no mercy to the Egyptians, 5
  and how wonderfully he dealt with his people.
  14 The Egyptians were worse than the So-
  domites. 18 The wonderful agreement of the
  creatures to serve God's people.

(Sirach)

Chapter 1
1 All wisdom is from God: 10 he giveth it to
  them that love him. 12 The fear of God is
  full of many blessings. 28 To fear God without
  hypocrisy.

Chapter 2
1 God's servants must look for trouble, 7 and be
  patient, and trust in him. 12 For woe to them
  that do not so. 5 But they that fear the Lord,
  will do so.

Chapter 3
2 Children must honour and help both their pa-
  rents. 21 We may not desire to know all things.
  26 The incorrigible must needs perish. 30 Alms
  are rewarded.

Chapter 4
1 We may not despise the poor or fatherless, 11 but
  seek for wisdom, 20 and not be ashamed of some
  things, nor gainsay the truth, 30 nor be as lions
  in our houses.

Chapter 5
1 We must not presume on our wealth and strength,
  6 nor on the mercy of God, to sin. 9 We must
  not be doubletongued, 12 nor answer without
  knowledge.

Chapter 6
2 Do not extol thine own conceit, 7 but make choice
  of a friend. 18 Seek wisdom betimes: 20 it is
  grievous to some, 28 yet the fruits thereof are
  pleasant. 35 Be ready to hear wise men.

Chapter 7
1 We are dehorted from sin, 4 from ambition, 8
  presumption, 10 and fainting in prayer: 12
  from lying and backbiting. 18 How to esteem
  a friend: 19 a good wife: 20 a servant:
  22 our cattle: 23 our children and parents:
  31 the Lord and his priests: 32 the poor and
  those that mourn.

Chapter 8
1 Whom we may not strive with, 8 nor despise,
  10 nor provoke, 15 nor have to do with.

Chapter 9
1 We are advised how to use our wives: 3 what
  women to avoid: 10 and not to change an old
  friend: 13 not to be familiar with men in au-
  thority: 14 but to know our neighbours: 15
  and to converse with wise men.

Chapter 10
1 The commodities of a wise ruler. 4 God setteth
  him up. 6 The inconveniencies of pride, injustice,
  and covetousness. 14 What God hath done to
  the proud. 19 Who shall be honoured, 29 and
  who not.

Chapter 11
4 We may not vaunt, nor set forth ourselves,
  8 nor answer rashly, 10 nor meddle with many
  matters. 14 Wealth and all things else are from
  God.  24 Brag not of thy wealth, 29 nor bring
  every man into thy house.

Chapter 12
2 Be not liberal to the ungodly. 10 Trust not
  thine enemy, nor the wicked.

Chapter 13
1 Keep not company with the proud, or a mightier
  than thyself. 15 Like will to like. 21 The
  difference between the rich and the poor. 25 A
  man's heart will change his countenance.

Chapter 14
1 A good conscience maketh men happy. 5 The
  niggard doeth good to none. 13 But do thou
  good. 20 Men are happy that draw near to
  wisdom.

Chapter 15
2 Wisdom embraceth those that fear God. 7 The
  wicked shall not get her. 11 We may not
  charge God with our faults: 14 for he made,
  and left us to ourselves.

Chapter 16
1 It is better to have none, than many lewd chil-
  dren. 6 The wicked are not spared for their
  number. 12 Both the wrath and the mercy of
  the Lord are great. 17 The wicked cannot be
  hid. 20 God's works are unsearchable.

Chapter 17
1 How God created and furnished men. 14 Avoid
  all sin: 19 for God seeth all things. 25 Turn
  to him while thou livest.

Chapter 18
4 God's works are to be wondered at. 9 Man's
  life is short. 11 God is merciful. 15 Do not
  blemish thy good deeds with ill words. 22 De-
  fer not to be justified. 30 Follow not thy
  lusts.

Chapter 19
2 Wine and women seduce wise men. 7 Say not
  all thou hearest. 17 Reprove thy friend without
  anger. 22 There is no wisdom in wickedness.

Chapter 20
1 Of silence and speaking. 10 Of gifts and gain.
  18 Of slipping by the tongue. 24 Of lying.
  27 Of divers advertisements.

Chapter 21
2 Flee from sin as from a serpent: 4 his op-
  pression will undo the rich. 9 The end of the
  unjust shall be naught. 12 The difference getween
  the fool and the wise.

Chapter 22
1 Of the slothful man, 3 and of a foolish daughter.
  11 Weep rather for fools than for the dead.
  13 Meddle not with them. 16 The wise man's
  heart will not shrink. 20 What will lose a
  friend.

Chapter 23
1 A prayer for grace to flee sin. 9 We may not
  use swearing: 14 but remember our parents.
  16 Of three sorts of sin. 23 The adulterous
  wife sinneth many ways.

Chapter 24
2 Wisdom doth praise herself, sheweth her begin-
  ning, 4 her dwelling, 13 her glory, 17 her
  fruit, 26 her increase and perfection.

Chapter 25
1 What things are beautiful, and what hateful.
  6 What is the crown of age. 7 What things
  make men happy. 13 Nothing worse than a
  wicked woman.

Chapter 26
1 A good wife, 4 and a good conscience, rejoice
  men. 6 A wicked wife is a fearful thing. 13
  Of good and bad wives. 28 Of three things
  that are grievous. 29 Merchants and hucksters
  are not without sin.

Chapter 27
1 Of sins in selling and buying. 7 Our speech will
  tell what is in us. 16 A friend is lost by disco-
  vering his secrets. 25 He that diggeth a pit,
  shall fall into it.

Chapter 28
1 Against revenge, 8 quarrelling, 10 anger, 13
  and backbiting.

Chapter 29
1 We must shew mercy, and lend: 4 but the bor-
  rower must not defraud the lender. 9 Give alms.
  14 A good man will not undo his surety. 18 To
  be surety, and undertake for others, is dangerous.
  22 It is better to live at home, than to sojourn.

Chapter 30
1 It is good to correct our children, 7 and not to
  cocker them. 14 Health is better than wealth.
  22 health and life are shortened by grief.

Chapter 31
1 Of the desire of riches. 12 Of moderation and
  excess in eating, or drinking wine.

Chapter 32
1 Of his duty that is chief or master in a feast.
  14 Of the fear of God. 18 Of counsel. 20 Of
  a ragged, and a smooth way. 23 Trust not to
  any but to thyself, and to God.

Chapter 33
1 The safety of him that feareth the Lord. 2 The
  wise and the foolish. 7 Times and seasons are
  of God. 10 Men are in his hands as clay in
  the hands of the potter. 18 Chiefly regard thy-
  self. 24 Of servants.

Chapter 34
1 Of dreams. 13 The praise and blessing of them
  that fear the Lord. 18 The offering of the
  ancient and prayer of the poor innocent.

Chapter 35
1 Sacrifices pleasing to God. 14 The prayer of the
  fatherless, of the widow, and of the humble in
  spirit. 20 Acceptable mercy.

Chapter 36
1 A prayer for the church against the enemies
  thereof. 18 A good heart, and a froward.
  21 Of a good wife.

Chapter 37
1 How to know friends and counsellers. 12 The
  discretion and wisdom of a godly man blesseth
  him. 27 Learn to refrain thine appetite.

Chapter 38
1 Honour due to the physician, and why. 16 How
  to weep and mourn for the dead. 24 The wis-
  dom of the learned man, and of the labourer
  and artificer: with the use of them both.

Chapter 39
1 A description of him that is truly wise. 12 An
  exhortation to praise God for his works; which
  are good to the good, and evil to them that are
  evil.

Chapter 40
1 Many miseries in a man's life. 12 The reward
  of unrighteousness, and the fruit of true dealing.
  17 A virtuous wife, and an honest friend rejoice
  the heart, but the fear of the Lord is above all.
  28 A beggar's life is hateful.

Chapter 41
1 The remembrance of death. 3 Death is not to
  be feared. 5 The ungodly shall be accursed.
  11 Of an evil and a good name. 14 Wisdom
  is to be uttered. 16 Of what things we should
  be ashamed.

  lon made, and sent in that book unto the brethren
  in Jerusalem.

  the two judges false.

  and casteth his enemies into the same den.

  abomination of desolation, 63 and slew those
  that did circumcise their children.

  24 he slayeth a Jew that did sacrifice to idols
  in his presence, and the king's messenger also:

  make no resistance: 50 he dieth, and instructeth
  his sons: 66 and maketh their brother Judas
  Maccabeus general.

Chapter 3
1 The valour and fame of Judas Maccabeus:

  Gorgias, 23 and spoileth their tents, 34 and

  ander, and entereth upon his kingdom. 17

  three days. 20 Jonathan besiegeth the tower at
  Jerusalem. 26 The Jews and he are much ho-
  noured by Demetrius, 48 who is rescued by the

  tiochus the younger honoureth Jonathan: 61 his
  exploits in divers places.

Chapter 12
1 Jonathan reneweth his league with the Romans,
  and Lacedemonians. 21 The forces of Deme-
  trius, thinking to surprize Jonathan, flee away
  for fear. 35 Jonathan fortifieth the castles
  in Judea, 48 and is shut up by the fraud of
  Tryphon in Ptolemais.

  annoy Judea.

Chapter 16
3 Judas and John prevail against the forces sent
  by Antiochus. 11 The captain of Jericho in-
  viteth Simon and two of his sons into his castle,

  that sought for him.

  to Joseph. 19 The angel satisfieth the mis-
  deeming thoughts of Joseph, and interpreteth the
  names of Christ.

  by a star: 11 they worship him and offer their
  presents. 14 Joseph fleeth into Egypt, with
  Jesus and his mother. 16 Herod slayeth the
  children: 20 himself dieth. 23 Christ is brought
  back again into Galilee, to Nazareth.

1 John preacheth; his office, life, and baptism:
  7 he reprehendeth the Pharisees, 13 and bap-
  tizeth Christ in Jordan.

Chapter 4
1 Christ fasteth, and is tempted. 11 The angels
  minister unto him: 13 he dwelleth in Caper-
  naum, 17 beginneth to preach, 18 calleth Peter
  and Andrew, 21 James and John, 23 and
  healeth all the diseased.

Chapter 5
1 Christ beginneth his sermon on the mount: 3 de-
  claring who are blessed, 13 who are the salt of
  the earth, 14 the light of the world, the city
  on an hill: 15 the candle: 17 that he came to
  fulfil the law. 21 What it is to kill, 27 to
  commit adultery, 33 to swear: 38 exhorteth
  to suffer wrong, 44 to love even our enemies,
  48 and to labour after perfectness.

Chapter 6
1 Christ continueth his sermon on the mount,
  speaking of alms, 5 prayer, 14 forgiving our
  bretheren, 16 fasting, 19 where our treasure is
  to be laid up, 24 of serving God and mammon:
  25 exhorteth not to be careful for worldly things;
  33 but to seek God's kingdom.

Chapter 7
1 Christ ending his sermon on the mount, reprov-
  eth rash judgement, 6 forbiddeth to cast holy
  things to the dogs, exhorteth to prayer, 13 to
  enter in at the strait gate, 15 to beware of false

  of the word: 24 like houses built on a rock,
  26 and not on the sand.

  rion's servant, 14 Peter's mother in law, 16 and

  the gospel to the simple, 28 he calleth to him
  all such as feel the burden of their sins.

Chapter 12
1 Christ reproveth the blindness of the Pharisees
  concerning the breach of the sabbath, 3 by
  scriptures, 10 by reason, 13 and by a miracle:
  22 he healeth the man possessed that was blind
  and dumb. 31 Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
  shall never be forgiven. 36 Account shall be
  made of idle words: 38 he rebuketh the un-
  faithful who seek after a sign, 49 and sheweth
  who is his brother, sister, and mother.

Chapter 13
3 The parable of the sower and the seed: 18 The
  exposition of it. 24 The parable of the tares,

  draw net cast into the sea: 53 and how Christ
  is contemned of his own countrymen.

  Baptist was beheaded. 13 Jesus departeth into

  landing at Gennesaret, healeth the sick by the
  touch of the hem of his garment.

Chapter 15
1 Christ reproveth the scribes and Pharisees for
  transgressing God's commandments through their
  own traditions; 11 teacheth how that which
  goeth into the mouth doth not defile a man:
  21 he healeth the daughter of the woman of
  Canaan, 30 and other great multitudes: 32
  and with seven loaves, and a few little fishes,
  feedeth four thousand men, beside women and
  children.

Chapter 16
1 The Pharisees require a sign. 6 Jesus warneth
  his disciples of the leaven of the Pharisees and
  Saducees. 13 The people's opinion of Christ,

  harmless, 7 to avoid offences, and not to despise
  the little ones: 15 teacheth how we are to deal
  with our brethren, when they offend us, 21 and
  how oft to forgive them; 23 which he setteth
  forth by a parable of the king, that took account
  of his servants, 32 and punished him who shewed
  no mercy to his fellow.

Chapter 19
2 Christ healeth the sick; 3 answereth the Phari-
  sees concerning divorcement: 10 sheweth when
  marriage is necessary: 13 receiveth little chil-
  dren: 16 instructeth the young man how to
  attain eternal life, 20 and how to be perfect:
  23 telleth his disciples how hard it is for a rich
  man to enter into the kingdom of God: 27 and
  promiseth reward to those that forsake any thing
  to follow him.

Chapter 20
1 Christ, by the similitude of the labourers in the
  vineyard, sheweth that God is debtor unto no
  man; 17 foretelleth his passion; 20 by answer-
  ing the mother of Zebedee's children, teacheth
  his disciples to be lowly; 30 and giveth two
  blind men their sight.

  great commandment, 41 and questioneth the
  Pharisees about the Messias.

Chapter 23
1 Christ admonisheth the people to follow the good
  doctrine, not the evil examples of the scribes
  and Pharisees: 5 his disciples must beware of
  their ambition; 13 he denounceth eight woes
  against their hypocrisy and blindness: 34 and
  prophesieth the destruction of Jerusalem.

Chapter 24
1 Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple:
  3 what and how great calamities shall be before
  it. 29 The signs of his coming to judgement,
  36 and because that day and hour is unknown,
  42 we ought to watch like good servants, ex-
  pecting every moment our master's coming.

Chapter 25
1 The parable of the ten virgins, 14 and of the
  talents. 31 Also the description of the last
  judgement.

  anointeth his head. 14 Judas selleth him. 17
  Christ eateth the passover: 26 instituteth his
  holy supper: 36 prayeth in the garden: 47
  and being betrayed with a kiss, 57 is carried to
  Caiaphas, 69 and denied of Peter.

Chapter 27
1 Christ is delivered bound to Pilate. 5 Judas
  hangeth himself. 19 Pilate admonished by his
  wife, 24 washeth his hands, 26 and looseth
  Barabbas. 29 Christ is crowned with thorns,
  34 crucified, 40 reviled, 50 dieth, and is
  buried: 66 his sepulchre is sealed and watched.

Chapter 28
1 Christ's resurrection is declared by an angel to
  the women: 9 he himself appeareth unto them.

  to teach and baptize all nations.

  Beelzebub: 31 and sheweth who are his bro-
  ther, sister, and mother.

  Divers opinions of Christ. 27 John Baptist is
  beheaded, 29 and buried. 30 The apostles re-

  loaves and two fishes. 48 Christ walketh on the
  sea: 53 and healeth all that touch him.

Chapter 7
1 The Pharisees find fault with the disciples, for
  eating with unwashen hands. 8 They break the
  commandment of God by the tradition of men.

  the Syrophenician woman's daughter of an
  unclean spirit, 31 and one that was deaf, and
  stammered in his speech.

  disciples to humility: 38 bidding them not to
  prohibit such as be not against them, nor to give

  rewards to them that forsake any thing for the

  27 and defendeth the lawfulness of his actions,
  by the witness of John, who was a man sent
  from God.

Chapter 12
1 In a parable of the vineyard let out to unthankful
  husbandmen, Christ foretelleth the reprobation of
  the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles: 13 he
  avoideth the snare of the Pharisees and Herodians
  about paying tribute to Cesar: 18 convinceth
  the error of the Sadducees, who denied the
  resurrection: 28 resolveth the scribe, who
  questioned of the first commandment: 35 refuteth

  32 The hour whereof being known to none,
  every man is to watch and pray, that we be not
  found unprovided, when he cometh to each one
  particularly by death.

Chapter 14
1 A conspiracy against Christ: 3 precious ointment
  is poured on his head by a woman. 10 Judas
  selleth his Master for money. 12 Christ himself
  foretelleth how he shall be betrayed by one of his
  disciples: 22 after the passover prepared, and
  eaten, instituteth his supper: 26 declareth afore-
  hand the flight of all his disciples, and Peter's
  denial. 43 Judas betrayeth him with a kiss:
  46 he is apprehended in the garden, 55 falsely
  accused, and impiously condemned of the Jews'
  council, 65 shamefully abused by them, 66 and
  thrice denied of Peter.

Chapter 15
1 Jesus brought bound and accused before Pilate.
  15 Upon the clamour of the common people, the
  murderer Barabbas is loosed, and Jesus delivered
  up to be crucified: 17 he is crowned with thorns,
  19 spit on, and mocked: 21 fainteth in bearing
  his cross: 27 hangeth between two thieves:
  29 suffereth the triumphing reproaches of the
  Jews: 39 but confessed by the centurion to be
  the Son of God: 43 and is honourably buried
  by Joseph.

Chapter 16
1 An angel declareth the resurrection of Christ to
  three women. 9 Christ himself appeareth to
  Mary Magdalene: 12 to two going into the
  country: 14 then to the apostles, 15 whom he
  sendeth forth to preach the gospel: 19 and
  ascendeth into heaven.

  16 The people of Nazareth admire his gracious
  words: 33 he cureth one possessed of a devil,
  38 Peter's mother in law, 40 and divers other
  sick persons. 41 The devils acknowledge Christ,
  and are reproved for it: 43 he preacheth
  through the cities.

Chapter 5
1 Christ teacheth the people out of Peter's ship;
  4 in a miraculous taking of fishes, sheweth how
  he will make him and his partners fishers of men;
  12 cleanseth the leper; 16 prayeth in the wil-

  hearted and weak disciples to worn garments
  and old bottles.

Chapter 6
1 Christ reproveth the Pharisees blindness about
  the observation of the sabbath, by scripture, rea-
  son, and miracle: 13 chooseth twelve apostles:
  17 healeth the diseased: 20 preacheth to his
  disciples before the people of blessings and curses;
  27 how we must love our enemies: 46 and
  join the obedience of good works to the hearing
  of the word, left in the evil day of temptation
  we fall like an house built upon the face of the
  earth without any foundation.

Chapter 7
1 Christ findeth a greater faith in the centurion, a
  Gentile, than in any of the Jews; 10 healeth
  his servant being absent; 11 raiseth from death
  the widow's son at Nain; 19 answereth John's
  messengers with the declaration of his miracles;
  24 testifieth to the people what opinion he held
  of John; 30 inveigheth against the Jews, who
  with neither the manners of John nor of Jesus
  could be won; 36 and sheweth by occasion of
  Mary Magdalene, how he is a friend to sinners,
  not to maintain them in sins, but to forgive
  them their sins, upon their fairh and repentance.

  of devils out of the man, into the herd of swine;
  37 is rejected of the Gadarenes; 43 healeth the
  woman of her bloody issue; 49 and raiseth from
  death Jairus's daughter.

Chapter 9
1 Christ sendeth his apostles to work miracles, and
  to preach. 7 Herod desireth to see Christ. 17
  Christ feedeth five thousand: 18 enquireth what
  opinion the world had of him: 22 foretelleth
  his passion: 23 proposeth to all the pattern of
  his patience. 28 The transfiguration. 37 He
  healeth the lunatick: 43 again forewarneth his
  disciples of his passion: 46 commendeth humility:
  51 biddeth them to shew mildness towards all,
  without desire of revenge. 57 Divers would
  follow him, but upon condition.

Chapter 10
1 Christ sendeth out at once seventy disciples to
  work miracles, and to preach: 17 admonisheth
  them to be humble, and wherein to rejoice: 21
  thanketh his Father for his grace: 23 magni-
  fieth the happy estate of his church: 25 teacheth
  the lawyer how to attain eternal life, and to
  take every one for his neighbour that needeth his
  mercy: 41 reprehendeth Martha, and com-
  mendeth Mary her sister

Chapter 11
1 Christ teacheth to pray, and that instantly: 11
  assuring that God so will give us good things:
  14 he casting out a dumb devil, rebuketh
  the blasphemous Pharisees: 28 and sheweth
  who are blessed: 29 preacheth to the people:
  37 and reprehendeth the outward shew of
  holiness in the Pharisees, scribes, and law-
  yers.

Chapter 12
1 Christ preacheth to his disciples to avoid hypo-
  crisy, and fearfulness in publishing his doctrine:
  13 warneth the people to beware of covetousness,
  by the parable of the rich man who set up greater
  barns. 22 We must not be over careful of earthly
  things; 31 but seek the kingdom of God, 33
  give alms, 36 be ready at a knock to open to our
  Lord whensoever he cometh. 41 Christ's ministers
  are to see to their charge, 49 and look for per-
  secution. 54 The people must take this time of
  grace, 58 because it is a fearful thing to die
  without reconciliation.

Chapter 13
1 Christ preacheth repentance upon the punishment
  of the Galileans, and others. 6 The fruitless fig
  tree may not stand. 11 He healeth the crooked
  woman: 18 sheweth the powerful working of
  the word in the hearts of his chosen, by the pa-
  rable of the grain of mustard seed, and of leaven:
  24 exhorteth to enter in at the strait gate: 31
  and reproveth Herod and Jerusalem.

Chapter 14
2 Christ healeth the dropsy on the sabbath: 7
  teacheth humility: 12 to feast the poor: 16
  under the parable of the great supper, sheweth
  how worldly minded men, who contemn the word
  of God, shall be shut out of heaven. 25 Those
  who will be his disciples, to bear their cross,
  must make their accounts aforehand, left with
  shame they revolt from him afterward, 34 and
  become altogether unprofitable, like salt that hath
  lost its savour.

Chapter 15
1 The parable of the lost sheep: 8 of the piece of
  silver: 11 of the prodigal son.

Chapter 16
1 The parable of the unjust steward. 14 Christ re-
  proveth the hypocrisy of the covetous Pharisees.

  One to forgive another. 6 The power of faith.

  11 He healeth ten lepers. 22 Of the kingdom of
  God, and the coming of the Son of man.

Chapter 18
3 Of the importunate widow. 9 Of the Pharisee
  and the publican. 15 Children brought to Christ.
  18 A ruler that would follow Christ, but is
  hindered by his riches. 28 The reward of them
  that leave all for his sake: 31 he foresheweth
  his death, 35 and restoreth a blind man to his
  sight.

Chapter 19
1 Of Zaccheus the publican. 11 The ten pieces of
  money. 28 Christ rideth into Jerusalem with
  triumph: 41 weepeth over it: 45 driveth the
  buyers and sellers out of the temple: 47 teach-
  ing daily in it, the rulers would have destroyed
  him, but for fear of the people.

Chapter 20
1 Christ avoucheth his authority, by a question of
  John's baptism. 9 The parable of the vine-
  yard. 19 Of giving tribute to Cesar: 27 he
  convinceth the Sadducees that denied the resur-
  rection. 41 How Christ is the son of David:
  45 he warneth his disciples to beware of the
  scribes.

Chapter 21
1 Christ commendeth the poor widow: 5 he fore-
  telleth the destruction of the temple, and of the
  city Jerusalem: 25 the signs also which shall be
  before the last day: 34 he exhorteth them to be
  watchful.

Chapter 22
1 The Jews conspire against Christ; 3 Satan pre-
  pareth Judas to betray him. 7 The apostles sent
  to prepare the passover. 19 Christ instituteth
  his holy supper: 21 covertly foretelleth of the
  traitor: 24 dehorteth the rest of his apostles
  from ambition: 32 assureth Peter his faith
  should not fail, 34 and yet he should deny him
  thrice: 39 he prayeth in the mount, and sweat-
  eth blood: 47 is betrayed with a kiss: 50 he
  healeth Malchus's ear: 54 he is thrice denied of
  Peter, 63 shamefully abused, 66 and confesseth
  himself to be the Son of God.

Chapter 23
1 Jesus is accused before Pilate, and sent to He-
  rod: 8 Herod mocketh him. 12 Herod and
  Pilate are made friends. 18 Barabbas is de-
  sired of the people, and is loosed by Pilate, and
  Jesus is given to be crucified: 27 he telleth the
  women that lament him the destruction of Jeru-
  salem: 34 prayeth for his enemies. 39 Two
  evil doers are crucified with him: 46 his death:
  50 his burial.

Chapter 24
1 Christ's resurrection is declared by two angels to
  the women that come to the sepulchre: 9 these
  report it to others. 13 Christ himself appeareth
  to the two disciples that went to Emmaus. 36
  Afterward he appeareth to the apostles, and re-
  proveth their unbelief: 47 giveth them a charge:
  49 promiseth the Holy Ghost: 51 and so as-
  cendeth into heaven.

Chapter 2
1 Christ turneth water into wine, 12 departeth
  into Capernaum, and to Jerusalem, 14 where

  would not trust himself with them.

Chapter 3
1 Christ teacheth Nicodemus the necessity of regene-
  ration: 14 of faith in his death. 16 The great

  tion for unbelief. 23 The baptism, withess, and
  doctrine of John concerning Christ.

Chapter 4
1 Christ talketh with a woman of Samaria, and
  revealeth himself unto her: 27 his disciples mar-
  vel: 31 he declareth to them his zeal for God's
  glory. 39 Many Samaritans believe on him:
  43 he departeth into Galilee, and healeth the
  ruler's son that lay sick at Capernaum.

Chapter 5
1 Jesus on the sabbath day cureth him that was
  diseased eight and thirty years: 10 the Jews
  therefore cavil, and persecute him for it: 17 he
  answereth for himself, and reproveth them,
  shewing by the testimony of his Father, 32 of
  John, 36 of his works, 39 and of the scrip-
  tures, who he is.

Chapter 6
1 Christ feedeth five thousand men with five loaves
  and two fishes. 15 Thereupon the people would
  have made him king. 16 But withdrawing
  himself, he walketh on the sea to his disciples:
  26 reproveth the people flocking after him, and
  all the fleshly hearers of his word: 32 declareth
  himself to be the bread of life to believers. 66
  Many disciples depart from him. 68 Peter con-
  fesseth him. 70 Judas is a devil.

Chapter 7
1 Jesus reproveth the ambition and boldness of his
  kinsmen: 10 goeth up from Galilee to the feast
  of tabernacles: 14 teacheth in the temple. 40
  Divers opinions of him among the people. 45
  The pharisees are angry that their officers took
  him not, and chide with Nicodemus for taking
  his part.

Chapter 8
1 Christ delivereth the woman taken in adultery:
  12 he preacheth himself the light of the world,
  and justifieth his doctrine; 33 answereth the
  Jews that boasted of Abraham, 59 and con-
  veyeth himself from their cruelty.

Chapter 9
1 The man that was born blind restored to sight:
  3 he is brought to the Pharisees: 18 they are
  offended at it, 34 and excommunicate him: 35
  but he is received of Jesus, and confesseth him.
  39 Who they are whom Christ enlighteneth.

Chapter 10
1 Christ is the door, and the good shepherd: 19
  divers opinions of him: 25 he proveth by his
  works, that he is Christ the Son of God; 39
  escapeth the Jews, 40 and went again beyond
  Jordan, where many believed on him.

Chapter 11
1 Christ raiseth Lazarus four days buried. 45
  Many Jews believe. 47 The chief priests and
  Pharisees gather a council against Christ. 49
  Caiaphas prophesieth. 54 Jesus hideth himself.
  55 At the passover they enquire after him, and
  lay wait for him.

Chapter 12
1 Jesus excuseth Mary anointing his feet. 9 The
  people flock to see Lazarus: 10 The chief priests
  consult to kill him. 12 Christ rideth into Jeru-
  salem. 20 Greeks desire to see Jesus: 23 he
  foretelleth his death. 37 The Jews are generally
  blinded: 42 yet many chief rulers believe, but
  do not confess him: 44 therefore Jesus calleth
  earnestly for confession of faith.

Chapter 13
1 Jesus washeth his disciples' feet: 14 exhorteth
  them to humility and charity: 18 he foretelleth
  and discovereth to John by a token, that Judas
  should betray him: 31 commandeth them to love
  one another: 36 and forewarneth Peter of his
  denial.

Chapter 14
1 Christ comforteth his disciples with the hope of
  heaven: 6 professeth himself the way, the truth,
  and the life; and one with the Father: 13 as-
  sureth their prayers in his name to be effectual:
  15 requesteth love and obedience: 16 promiseth
  the Holy Ghost the Comforter: 27 and leaveth
  his peace with them.

Chapter 15
1 The consolation and mutual love between Christ
  and his members under the parable of the vine.
  18 A comfort in the hatred and persecution of
  the world. 26 The office of the Holy Ghost, and
  of the apostles.

  by the promise of the Holy Ghost, and by his
  resurrection and ascension: 23 assureth their
  prayers made in his name to be acceptable to his
  Father. 33 Peace in Christ, and in the world
  affliction.

Chapter 17
1 Christ prayeth to his Father to glorify him: 6
  to preserve his apostles, 11 in unity, 17 and
  truth: 20 to glorify them, and all other be-
  lievers with him in heaven.

Chapter 18
1 Judas betrayeth Jesus. 6 The officers fall to
  the ground. 10 Peter smiteth off Malchus' ear.
  12 Jesus is taken and led unto Annas and Cai-
  aphas. 15 Peter's denial. 19 Jesus examined
  before Caiaphas: 28 his arraignment before
  Pilate: 36 his kingdom. 40 The Jews ask
  Barabbas to be let loose.

Chapter 19
1 Christ is scourged, crowned with thorns, and
  beaten. 4 Pilate is desirous to release him, but
  being overcome with the outrage of the Jews, he
  delivered him to be crucified. 23 They cast lots
  for his garments: 26 he commendeth his mother
  to John: 28 he dieth: 31 his side is pierced:
  38 he is buried by Joseph and Nicodemus.

Chapter 20
1 Mary cometh to the sepulchre; 3 so do Peter
  and John, ignorant of the resurrection: 11 Je-
  sus appeareth to Mary Magdalene, 19 and to
  his disciples. 24 The incredulity and confession
  of Thomas. 30 The scripture is sufficient to
  salvation.

Chapter 21
1 Christ appearing again to his disciples, was
  known of them by the great draught of fishes:
  12 he dineth with them; 15 earnestly com-
  mandeth Peter to feed his lambs and sheep; 18
  fortelleth him of his death; 22 rebuketh his
  curiosity touching John. 25 The conclusion.

(Acts)

Chapter 1
1 Christ preparing his apostles to the beholding of his
  ascension, gathereth them together into the mount
  Olivet, commandeth them to expect in Jerusalem
  the sending down of the Holy Ghost, promiseth
  after few days to send it: by virtue whereof
  they should be witnesses unto him, even to the
  utmost parts of the earth. 9 After his ascension
  they are warned by two angels to depart, and to
  set their minds upon his second coming: 12 they
  accordingly return, and giving themselves to
  prayer, choose Matthias apostle in place of
  Judas.

Chapter 2
1 The apostles, filled with the Holy Ghost, and
  speaking divers languages, are admired by some,
  and derided by others: 14 whom Peter dis-
  proving, and shewing that the apostles spake by
  the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus was
  risen from the dead, ascended into heaven, had
  poured down the same Holy Ghost, and was the
  Messias, a man known to them  to be approved
  of God by his miracles, wonders, and signs, and
  not crucified without his determinate counsel,
  and foreknowledge: 37 he baptizeth a great
  number that were converted, 41 who after-
  wards devoutly and charitable converge together:
  the apostles working many miracles, and God
  daily increasing his church.

Chapter 3
1 Peter preaching to the people that came to see a
  lame man restored to his feet, 12 professeth the
  cure not to have been wrought by his or John's
  own power, or holiness, but by God, and his Son
  Jesus, and through faith in his name: 13 withal
  reprehending them for crucifying Jesus. 17 Which
  because they did it through ignorance, and that
  thereby were fulfilled God's determinate counsel,
  and the scriptures, 19 he exhorteth them by re-
  pentance and faith to seek remission of their sins,
  and salvation in the same Jesus.

Chapter 4
1 The rulers of the Jews offended with Peter's ser-
  mon, 4 (though thousands of the people were
  converted that heard the word) imprison him
  and John. 5 After, upon examination, Peter
  boldly avouching the lame man to be healed by
  the name of Jesus, and that by the same Jesus
  only we must be eternally saved, 13 they command
  him and John to preach no more in that name,
  adding also threatening. 23 Whereupon the
  church fleeth to prayer: 31 and God, by moving
  the place where they were assembled, testified
  that he heard their prayer, confirming the church
  with the gift of the Holy Ghost, and with mu-
  tual love and charity.

Chapter 5
1 After that Ananias and Sapphira his wife for
  their hypocrisy at Peter's rebuke had fallen down
  dead, 12 and that the rest of the apostles had
  wrought many miracles, 14 to the increase of
  the faith: 17 the apostles are again imprisoned,
  19 but delivered by an angel, bidding them to
  preach openly to all: 21 when after their
  teaching accordingly in the temple, 29 and be-
  fore the council, 33 they are in danger to be
  killed; through the advice of Gamaliel, a great
  counseller among the Jews, they be kept alive,
  40 and are but beaten: for which they glorify
  God, and cease no day from preaching.

Chapter 6
1 The apostles desirous to have the poor regarded
  for their bodily sustenance, as also careful them-
  selves to dispense the word of God, the food of
  the soul, 3 appoint the office of deaconship to
  seven chosen men: 5 of whom, Stephen, a man
  full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, is one:
  12 who is taken of those whom he confounded
  in disputing, 13 and after falsely accused of
  blasphemy against the law and the temple.

Chapter 7
1 Stephen permitted to answer to the accusation of
  blasphemy, 2 sheweth that Abraham worshipped
  God rightly, and how God chose the fathers, 20
  before Moses was born, and before the tabernacle
  and temple were built: 37 that Moses himself
  witnessed of Christ: 44 and that all outward
  ceremonies were ordained according to the heavenly
  pattern to last but for a time. 51 reprehending
  their rebellion, and murdering of Christ, the Just
  One, whom the prophets foretold should come into
  the world: 54 whereupon they stone him to
  death: who commendeth his soul to Jesus, and
  humbly prayeth for them.

Chapter 8
1 By occasion of the persecution in Jerusalem, the
  church being planted in Samaria, 5 by Philip
  the deacon, who preached, did miracles, and
  baptized many, among the rest Simon the sorcerer,
  a great seducer of the people; Peter and John
  come to confirm and enlarge the church: where
  by prayer and imposition of hands, giving the
  Holy Ghost, 18 when Simon would have bought
  the like power of them, 20 Peter sharply
  reproving his hypocrisy, and covetousness, and
  exhorting him to repentance, together with John
  preaching the word of the Lord, return to Je-
  rusalem. 26 But the angel sendeth Philip to
  teach, and baptize the Ethiopian eunuch.

Chapter 9
1 Saul going towards Damascus, 4 is stricken
  down to the earth, 10 is called to the apostle-
  ship, 18 and is baptized by Ananias; 20 he
  preacheth Christ boldly: 23 the Jews lay wait
  to kill him; 29 so do the Grecians: but he
  escapeth both. 31 The church having rest, Pe-
  ter healeth Eneas of the palsy, 36 and restoreth
  Tabitha to life.

Chapter 10
1 Cornelius, a devout man, 5 being commanded
  by an angel, sendeth for Peter: 11 who by a
  vision, 15, 20 is taught not to despise the Gen-
  tiles. 34 As he preacheth Christ to Cornelius
  and his company, 44 the Holy Ghost falleth on
  them, 48 and they are baptized.

Chapter 11
1 Peter being accused for going in to the Gentiles,
  5 maketh his defence, 18 which is accepted.
  19 The gospel being spread into Phenice, and
  Cyprus, and Antioch, Barnabas is sent to confirm
  them. 26 The disciples there are first called
  Christians: 27 they send relief to the brethren
  in Judea in time of famine.

Chapter 12
1 King Herod persecuteth the Christians, killeth
  James, and imprisoneth Peter, whom an angel
  delivereth upon the prayers of the church. 20 In
  his pride, taking to himself the honour due to
  God, he is stricken by an angel, and dieth
  miserably. 24 After his death the word of God
  prospereth.

Chapter 13
1 Paul and Barnabas are chosen to go to the
  Gentiles. 7 Of Sergius Paulus, and Elymas
  the sorcerer.  14 Paul preacheth at Antioch,
  that Jesus is Christ. 42 The Gentiles believe;
  45 but the Jews gainsay, and blaspheme: 46
  whereupon they turn to the Gentiles. 48 As
  many as were ordained to life, believed.

Chapter 14
1 Paul and Barnabas are persecuted from Iconium.
  8 At Lystra Paul healeth a cripple; whereupon
  they are reputed as gods. 19 Paul is stoned.
  21 They pass through divers churches, confirm-
  ing the disciples in faith and patience: 26 re-
  turning to Antioch, they report what God had
  done with them.

Chapter 15
1 Great dissension ariseth touching circumcision. 6 The
  apostles consult about it: 22 and send their de-
  termination by letters to the churches. 36 Paul
  and Barnabas, thinking to visit the brethren to-
  gether, fall at strife, and depart asunder.

Chapter 16
1 Paul having circumcised Timothy, 7 and being
  called by the Spirit from one country to another,
  14 converteth Lyaia, 16 casteth out a spirit of
  divination. 19 For which cause he and Silas
  are whipped and imprisoned. 26 The prison
  doors are opened. 31 The jailor is converted,
  37 and they are delivered.

Chapter 17
1 Paul preacheth at Thessalonica: 4 where some
  believe, and others persecute him: 10 he is sent
  to Berea, and preacheth there: 13 being perse-
  cuted at Thessalonica, 15 he cometh to Athens,
  and disputeth and preacheth the living God to
  them unknown, 34 whereby many are converted
  unto Christ.

Chapter 18
3 Paul laboureth with his hands, and preacheth
  at Corinth to the Gentiles: 9 the Lord encou-
  rageth him in a vision: 12 he is accused before
  Gallio the deputy, but is dismissed: 18 after-
  wards passing from city to city, he strengthened
  the disciples. 24 Apollos being more perfectly
  instructed by Aquila and Priscilla, 21 preacheth
  Christ with great efficacy.

Chapter 19
6 The Holy Ghost is given by Paul's hands: 9
  the Jews blaspheme his doctrine, which is con-
  firmed by miracles. 13 The Jews exorcists, 16
  are beaten by the devil. 19 Conjuring books are
  burnt. 24 Demetrius for love of gain, raiseth
  an uproar against Paul, 35 which is appeased
  by the townclerk.

Chapter 20
1 Paul goeth to Macedonia: 7 he celebrateth the
  Lord's supper, and preacheth. 9 Eutychus hav-
  ing fallen down dead, 10 is raised to life. 17
  At Miletus he calleth the elders together, telleth
  them what shall befal to himself, 28 committeth
  God's flock to them, 29 warneth them of false
  teachers, 32 commendeth them to God, 36 pray-
  eth with them, and goeth his way.

Chapter 21
1 Paul will not by any means be dissuaded from
  going to Jerusalem. 9 Philip's daughters pro-
  phetesses. 17 Paul cometh to Jerusalem; 27
  where he is apprehended, and in great danger,
  31 but by the chief captain is rescued, and per-
  mitted to speak to the people.

Chapter 22
1 Paul declareth at large how he was converted
  to the faith, 17 and called to his apostleship.
  22 At the very mentioning of the Gentiles, the
  people exclaim on him: 24 he would have been
  scourged; 25 but claiming the privilege of a
  Roman, he escapeth.

Chapter 23
1 As Paul pleadeth his cause, 2 Ananias com-
  mandeth them to smite him: 7 dissension among
  his accusers: 11 God encourageth him. 14 The
  Jews laying wait for Paul, 20 is declared unto
  the chief captain: 27 he sendeth him to Felix
  the governor.

Chapter 24
1 Paul being accused by Tertulius the orator, 10
  answereth for his life and doctrine: 24 he
  preacheth Christ to the governor and his wife.
  26 The governor hopeth for a bribe, but in vain.
  27 At last going out of his office, he leaveth
  Paul in prison.

Chapter 25
2 The Jews accuse Paul before Festus: 8 he
  answereth for himself, 11 and appealeth unto
  Cesar. 14 Afterwards Festus openeth his matter
  to king Agrippa, 23 and he is brought forth.
  25 Festus cleareth him to have done nothing
  worthy of death.

Chapter 26
2 Paul in the presence of Agrippa, declareth his
  life from his childhood, 12 and how miraculously
  he was converted, and called to his apostleship.
  24 Festus chargeth him to be mad, whereunto
  he answereth modestly. 28 Agrippa is almost
  persuaded to be a Christian. 31 The whole
  company pronounce him innocent.

Chapter 27
1 Paul shipping toward Rome, 10 foretelleth of
  the danger of the voyage, 11 but is not be-
  lieved: 14 they are tossed to and fro with a
  tempest, 41 and suffer shipwreck; 22, 34,
  44 yet all come safe to land.

Chapter 28
1 Paul after his shipwreck is kindly entertained of
  the barbarians: 5 the viper on his hand hurteth
  him not: 8 he healeth many diseased in the
  island. 11 They depart towards Rome: 17 he
  declareth to the Jews the cause of his coming:
  24 after his preaching some were persuaded, and
  some believed not: 30 yet he preacheth there two
  years.

(Romans)

Chapter 1
1 Paul commendeth his calling to the Romans, 9
  and his desire to come to them. 16 What his
  gospel is, and the righteousness which it sheweth.
  18 God is angry with all manner of sin. 21
  What are the sins of the Gentiles.

Chapter 2
1 They that sin, though they condemn it in others,
  cannot excuse themselves, 6 and much less escape
  the judgement of God, 9 whether they be Jews
  or Gentiles. 14 The Gentiles cannot escape, 17
  nor yet the Jews, 25 whom their circumcision
  shall not profit, if they keep not the law.

Chapter 3
1 The Jews' prerogative: 3 which they have not
  lost. 9 Howbeit, the law convinceth them also
  of sin. 20 Therefore no flesh is justified by the
  law, 28 but all, without difference, by faith
  only: 31 and yet the law is not abolished.

Chapter 4
1 Abraham's faith is imputed to him for righte-
  ousness, 10 before he was circumcised. 13 By faith
  only he and his seed received the promise. 16 Abra-
  ham is the father of all that believe. 24 Our faith
  also shall be imputed to us for righteousness.

Chapter 5
1 Being  justified by faith, we have peace with God,
  2 and joy in our hope; 8 that since we were
  reconciled by his blood, when we were enemies,
  10 we shall much more be saved being reconciled.
  12 As sin and death come by Adam, 17 so much
  more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ. 20
  Where sin abounded, grace did superabound.

Chapter 6
1 We may not live in sin, 2 for we are dead unto
  it, 3 as appeareth by our baptism. 12 Let not
  sin reign any more, 18 because we have yielded
  ourselves to the service of righteousness, 23 and
  for that death is the wages of sin.

Chapter 7
1 No law hath power over a man longer than he
  liveth. 4 But we are dead to the law. 7 Yet
  is not the law sin, 12 but holy, just, and good,
  16 as I acknowledge who am grieved because I
  cannot keep it.

Chapter 8
1 They that are in Christ, and live according to
  the Spirit, are free from condemnation. 5, 13
  What harm cometh of the flesh, 6, 14 and
  what good of the Spirit, 17 and what of being
  God's children: 19 whose glorious deliverance
  all things long for. 29 It was before hand
  decreed from God. 38 What can sever us from
  his love?

Chapter 9
1 Paul is sorry for the Jews. 7 All the seed of
  Abraham were not the children of the promise.
  18 God hath mercy upon whom he will. 21 The
  potter may do with his clay what he list. 25 The
  calling of the Gentiles, and rejecting of the Jews
  were foretold. 32 The cause why so few Jews
  embraced the righteousness of faith.

Chapter 10
5 The scripture sheweth the difference betwixt the
  righteousness of the law, and this of faith: 11
  and that all, both Jew and Gantile, that believe,
  shall not be confounded: 18 and that the
  Gentiles shall receive the word, and believe. 19
  Israel was not ignorant of these things.

Chapter 11
1 God hath not cast off all Israel. 7 Some were
  elected, though the rest were hardened. 16
  There is hope of their conversion. 18 The
  Gentiles may not insult upon them: 26 for
  there is a promise of their salvation. 33 God's
  judgements are unsearchable.

Chapter 12
1 God's mercies must move us to please God. 3 No
  man must think too well of himself, 6 but attend
  every one on that calling wherein he is placed.
  9 Love and many other duties are required of
  us. 19 Revenge is specially forbidden.

Chapter 13
1 Subjection and many other duties we owe to the
  magistrates. 8 Love is the fulfilling of the law.
  11 Gluttony and drunkenness, and the works
  of darkness, are out of season in the time of the
  gospel.

Chapter 14
3 Men may not contemn nor condemn one the other
  for things indifferent; 13 but take heed that
  they give no offence in them; 15 for that the
  apostle proveth unlawful by many reasons.

Chapter 15
1 The strong must bear with the weak. 2 We
  may not please ourselves, 3 for Christ did not
  so, 7 but receive one the other, as Christ did us
  all, 8 both Jews, 9 and Gentiles. 15 Paul
  excuseth his writing, 28 and promiseth to see
  them, 30 and requesteth their prayers.

Chapter 16
3 Paul willeth the brethren to greet many; 17 and
  adviseth them to take heed of those which cause
  dissension and offences; 21 and after sundry
  salutatioins endeth with praise and thanks to God.

(1 Corinthians)

Chapter 1
1 After his salutation and thanksgiving, 10 he ex-
  horteth them to unity, 12 and reproveth their
  dissensions. 18 God destroyeth the wisdom of the
  wise, 21 by the foolishness of preaching; and
  26 calleth not the wise, mighty, and noble, but
  27, 28 the foolish, weak, and men of no account.

Chapter 2
1 He declareth that his preaching, though it bring
  not excellency of speech, or of 4 human wis-
  dom; yet consisteth in the 4, 5 power of God;
  and so far excelleth 6 the wisdom of this world,
  and 9 human sense, as that 14 the natural man
  cannot understand it.

Chapter 3
2 Milk is fit for children. 3 Strife and division,
  arguments of a fleshly mind. 7 He that plant-
  eth and he that watereth is nothing. 9 The mi-
  nisters are God's fellow workmen. 11 Christ the
  only foundation. 16 Men the temples of God,
  17 which must be kept holy. 19 The wisdom of
  this world is foolishness with God.

Chapter 4
1 In what account the ministers ought to be had.
  7 We have nothing which we have not received.
  9 The apostles, spectacles to the world, angels,
  and men, 13 the fish, and offscouring of the
  world; 15 yet our fathers in Christ, 16 whom
  we ought to follow.

Chapter 5
1 The incestuous person, 6 is cause rather of shame
  unto them, than of rejoicing. 7 The old leaven
  is to be purged out. 10 Heinous offenders are
  to be shunned and avoided.

Chapter 6
1 The Corinthians must not vex their brethren, in
  going to law with them; 6 especially under in-
  fidels. 9 The unrighteous shall not inherit the
  kingdom of God. 15 Our bodies are the members
  of Christ, 19 and temples of the Holy Ghost:
  16, 17 they must not therefore be defiled.

Chapter 7
2 He treateth of marriage, 4 shewing it to be a
  remedy against fornication; 10 and that the
  bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved.
  18, 20 Every man must be content with his
  vocation. 25 Virginity wherefore to be embraced.
  35 And for what respects we may either marry,
  or abstain from marrying.

Chapter 8
1 To abstain from meats offered to idols. 8, 9 We
  must not abuse our Christian liberty, to the
  offence of our brethren: 11 but must bridle
  our knowledge with charity.

Chapter 9
1 He sheweth his liberty, 7 and that the minister
  ought to live by the gospel: 15 yet that himself
  hath of his own accord abstained, 18 to be either
  chargeable unto them, 22 or offensive unto any in
  matters indifferent. 24 Our life is like unto a race.

Chapter 10
1 The sacraments of the Jews, 6 are types of
  our's, 7 and their punishments, 11 examples
  for us. 14 We must flee from idolatry. 21 We
  must not make the Lord's table the table of
  devils: 24 and in things indifferent we must
  have regard of our brethren.

Chapter 11
1 He reproveth them, because in holy assemblies
  4 their men prayed with their heads covered, 6
  and women with their heads uncovered: 17 and
  because generally, their meetings were not for the
  better, but for the worse; 21 as namely, in pro-
  faning with their own feasts the Lord's supper.
  23 Lastly, he calleth them to the first institution
  thereof.

Chapter 12
1 Spiritual gifts 4 are diverse, 7 yet all to profit
  withal; 8 and to that end are diversly bestowed:
  12 that by the like proportion, as the members of
  a natural body tend all to the 16 mutual decency,
  22 service, and 26 succour of the same body;
  27 so we should do one for another, to make up
  the mystical body of Christ.

Chapter 13
1 All gifts, 2, 3 how excellent soever, are nothing
  worth without charity: 4 the praises thereof,
  13 and prelation before hope and faith.

Chapter 14
1 Prophecy is commended, 2, 3, 4 and preferred
  before speaking with tongues, 6 by a comparison
  drawn from musical instruments. 12 Both must
  be referred to edification, 22 as to their true
  and proper end. 26 The true use of each is
  taught, 29 and abuse taxed. 34 Women are
  forbidden to speak in the church.

Chapter 15
3 By Christ's resurrection, 12 he proveth the neces-
  sity of our resurrection, against all such as deny
  the resurrection of the body. 21 The fruit, 35
  and manner thereof, 51 and of the changing of
  them that shall be found alive at the last day.

Chapter 16
1 He exhorteth them to relieve the want of the
  brethren at Jerusalem; 10 commendeth Timothy:
  13 and after friendly admonitions, 16 shutteth
  up his epistle with divers salutations.

(2 Corinthians)

Chapter 1
3 The apostle encourageth them against troubles, by
  the comforts and deliverances which God had
  given him, as in all his afflictions, 8 so particu-
  larly in his late danger in Asia: 12 and calling
  both his own conscience and their's to witness of
  his sincere manner of preaching the immutalbe
  truth of the gospel, 15 he excuseth his not
  coming to them, and proceeding not of lightness,
  but of his lenity towards them.

Chapter 2
1 Having shewed the reason why he came not to
  them, 6 he requireth them to forgive and to
  comfort that excommunicated person, 10 even
  as himself also, upon his due repentance, had
  forgiven him: 12 declaring withal why he
  departed from Troas to Macedonia, 14 and the
  happy success which God gave to his preaching
  in all places.

Chapter 3
1 Lest their false teachers should charge him with
  vain glory, he sheweth the faith and graces of
  the Corinthians to be a sufficient commendation
  of his ministry. 6 Whereupon, entering a com-
  parison between the ministers of the law, and of
  the gospel, 12 he proveth that his ministry is
  so far the more excellent, as the gospel of life
  and liberty is more glorious than the law of
  condemnation.

Chapter 4
1 He declareth how he hath used all sincerity and
  faithful diligence in preaching the gospel; 7 and
  how the troubles and persecutions which he daily
  endured for the same, did redound to the praise
  of God's power, 12 to the benefit of the church,
  16 and to the apostle's own eternal glory.

Chapter 5
1 That in his assured hope of immortal glory, 9
  and in expectance of it, and of the general judge-
  ment, he laboureth to keep a good conscience;
  12 not that he may herein boast of himself, 14
  but as one that having received life from Christ,
  endeavoureth to live as a new creature to Christ
  only, 18 and by his ministry of reconciliation to
  reconcile others also in Christ to God.

Chapter 6
1 That he hath approved himself a faithful minister
  of Christ, both by his exhortations, 3 and by
  integrity of life, 4 and by patient enduring all
  kinds of affliction, and disgraces for the gospel.
  10 Of which he speaketh the more boldly amongst
  them, because his heart is open to them; 13 and
  he expecteth the like affection from them again:
  14 exhorting to flee the society and pollution of
  idolaters, as being themselves temples of the
  living God.

Chapter 7
1 He proceedeth in exhorting them to purity of life,
  2 and to bear him like affection as he doth to
  them. 3 Whereof left they might seem to doubt,
  he declareth what comfort he took in his afflic-
  tions, by the report which Titus gave of their
  godly sorrow, which his former epistle had
  wrought in them, 13 and of their lovingkind-
  ness and obedience towards Titus, answerable
  to his former boastings of them.

Chapter 8
1 He stirreth them up to a liberal contribution
  for the poor saints at Jerusalem, by the exam-
  ple of the Macedonians, 7 by commendation of
  their former forwardness, 9 by the example of
  Christ, 14 and by the spiritual profit that shall
  redound to themselves thereby: 16 commending
  to them the integrity and willingness of Titus,
  and those other brethren, who upon his request,
  exhortation, and commendation, were purposely
  come to them for this business.

Chapter 9
1 He yieldeth the reason why, though he knew their
  forwardness, yet he sent Titus and his brethren
  beforehand: 6 and he proceedeth in stirring
  them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind
  of sowing of seed, 10 which shall return a great
  increase to them, 13 and occasion a great sacrifice
  of thanksgivings unto God.

Chapter 10
1 Against the false apostles, who disgraced the
  weakness of his person and bodily presence, he
  setteth out the spiritual might and authority
  with which he armed against all adversary
  powers; 7 assuring them that at his coming he
  will be found as mighty in word, as he is now
  in writing being absent: 12 and withal taxing
  them for reaching out themselves beyond their
  compass, and vaunting themselves into other
  men's labours.

Chapter 11
1 Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who
  seemed to make more account of the false apostles,
  than of him, he entered into a forced commen-
  dation of himself, 5 of his equality with the chief
  apostles, 7 of his preaching the gospel to them
  freely, and without any their charge: 13 shew-
  ing that he was not inferior to those deceitful
  workers, in any legal prerogative; 23 and in
  the service of Christ, and in all kind of sufferings
  for his ministry, far superior.

Chapter 12
1 For commending of his apostleship, though he
  might glory of his wonderful revelations, 9 yet
  he rather chooseth to glory of his infirmities, 11
  blaming them for forcing him to this vain boast-
  ing: 14 he promiseth to come to them again;
  but yet altogether in the affection of a father,
  20 although he feareth he shall to his grief find
  many offenders, and publick disorders there.

Chapter 13
1 He threateneth severity, and the power of his
  apostleship against obstinate sinners: 5 and ad-
  vising them to a trial of their faith, 7 and to
  reformation of their sins before his coming, 11
  he concludeth his epistle with a general exhorta-
  tion and a prayer.

(Galatians)

Chapter 1
6 He wondereth that they have so soon left him
  and the gospel; and accurseth those that preach
  any other gospel than he did: 11 he learned the
  gospel not of men, but of God; 13 and sheweth
  what he was before his calling, 17 and what he
  did presently after it.

Chapter 2
1 He sheweth when he went up again to Jerusalem,
  and for what purpose; 3 and that Titus was
  not circumcised: 11 and that he resisted Peter,
  and told him the reason, 14 why he and others,
  being Jews do believe in Christ to be justified by
  faith, and not by works: 23 and that they live
  not in sin, who are so justified.

Chapter 3
1 He asketh what moved them to leave the faith,
  and depend upon the laws. 6 They that believe
  are justified, 9 and blessed with Abraham. 10
  And this he sheweth by many reasons.

Chapter 4
1 We were under the law till Christ came, as the
  heir is under his guardian till he be of age. 5
  But Christ freed us from the law: 7 therefore
  we are servants no longer to it: 14 he remem-
  bereth their good will to him, and his to them;
  22 and sheweth that we are the sons of Abra-
  ham by the freewoman.

Chapter 5
1 He moveth them to stand in their liberty, 3 and
  not to observe circumcision; 13 but rather love,
  which is the sum of the law; 19 he reckoneth
  up the works of the flesh, 22 and the fruits of
  the Spirit; 25 and exhorteth to walk in the
  Spirit.

Chapter 6
1 He moveth them to deal mildly with a brother
  that hath slipped, 2 and to bear one another's
  burden, 6 to be liberal to their teachers, 9 and
  not weary of well doing: 12 he sheweth what
  they intend that preach circumcision: 14 he glo-
  rieth in nothing, save in the cross of Christ.

(Ephesians)

Chapter 1
1 After the salutation, 3 and thanksgiving for the
  Ephesians, 4 he treateth of our election, 6 and
  adoption by grace, 11 which is the true and
  proper fountain of man's salvation. 13 And
  because the height of this mystery cannot easily
  be attained unto, 16 he prayeth that they may
  come 18 to the full knowledge, 20 and pos-
  session thereof in Christ.

Chapter 2
1 By comparing what we were by 3 nature, with
  what we are 5 by grace, 10 he declareth that
  we are made for good works; 13 and being
  brought near by Christ, should not live as 11 Gen-
  tiles and 12 foreigners in time past, 19 but as
  citizens with the saints and the family of God.

Chapter 3
5 The hidden mystery, 6 that the Gentiles should
  be saved, 7 was made known to Paul by reve-
  lation: 8 and to him was that grace given,
  9 that he should preach it: 13 he desireth them
  not to faint for his tribulation, 14 and prayeth
  19 that they may perceive the great love of Christ
  toward them.

Chapter 4
1 He exhorteth to unity; 7 and declareth that God
  therefore giveth divers 11 gifts unto men, that
  his church might be 13 edified and 16 grown up
  in Christ: 18 he calleth them from the impurity
  of the Gentiles, 24 to put on the new man,
  25 to cast off lying, 29 and corrupt commu-
  nication.

Chapter 5
2 After general exhortations to love, 3 to flee for-
  nication, 4 and all uncleanness, 7 not to converse
  with the wicked, 15 to walk warily, and to be
  18 filled with the Spirit, 22 he defendeth to
  the particular duties, how wives ought to obey
  their husbands, 25 and husbands ought to love
  their wives, 32 even as Christ his church.

Chapter 6
1 The duty of children toward their parents. 5 Of
  servants toward their masters. 10 Our life is
  a warfare, 12 not only against flesh and blood,
  but also spiritual enemies. 13 The compleat ar-
  mour of a Christian, 18 and how it ought to be
  used. 21 Tychicus is commended.

(Philippians)

Chapter 1
3 He testifieth his thankfulness to God, and his love
  toward them, for the fruits of their faith, and
  fellowship in his sufferings, 9 daily praying to him
  for their increase in grace: 12 he sheweth what
  good the faith of Christ had received by his trou-
  bles at Rome, 21 and how ready he is to glorify
  Christ, either by his life or death: 27 exhorting
  them to unity, 28 and to fortitude in persecution.

Chapter 2
1 He exhorteth them to unity, and to all humble-
  ness of mind, by the example of Christ's humility
  and exaltation: 12 to a careful proceeding in
  the way of salvation, that they be as lights to
  the wicked world, 16 and comforts to him their
  apostle, who is now ready bo be offered up to God:
  19 he hopeth to send Timothy to them, whom he
  greatly commendeth, 25 as Epaphroditus also,
  whom he presently sendeth to them.

Chapter 3
1 He warneth them to beware of the false teach-
  ers of the circumcision, 4 shewing that himself
  hath greater cause than they to trust in the
  righteousness of the law: 7 which nonwithstand-
  ing he counteth as dung and loss, to gain Christ
  and his righteousness, 12 therein acknowledging
  his own imperfection: 15 he exhorteth them to
  be thus minded, 17 and to imitate him, 18 and
  to decline the ways of carnal christians.

Chapter 4
1 From particular admonitions, 4 he proceedeth
  to general exhortations, 10 shewing how he
  rejoiced at their liberality towards him lying
  in prison, not so much for the supply of his
  own wants, as for the grace of God in them:
  19 and so he concludeth with prayer and salu-
  tations.

(Colossians)

Chapter 1
1 After salutation, he thanketh God for their
  faith, 7 confirmeth the doctrine of Epaphras,
  9 prayeth further for their increase in grace,
  14 describeth the true Christ; 21 encourageth
  them to receive Jesus Christ; and commendeth
  his own ministry.

Chapter 2
1 He still exhorteth them to be constant in Christ,
  8 to beware of philosophy, and vain traditions,
  18 worshipping of angels, 20 and legal ceremo-
  nies, which are ended in Christ.

Chapter 3
1 He sheweth where we should seek Christ: 5 he
  exhorteth to mortification, 10 to put off the old
  man, and to put on Christ; 12 exhorting to
  charity, humility, and several other duties.

Chapter 4
1 He exhorteth them to be fervent in prayer, 5 to
  walk wisely toward them that are not yet come
  to the true knowledge of Christ: 10 he saluteth
  them, and wisheth them all prosperity.

(1 Thessalonians)

Chapter 1
1 The Thessalonians are given to understand both
  how mindful of them Saint Paul was at all
  times in thanksgiving, and prayer; 5 and also
  how well he was persuaded of the truth and sin-
  cerity of their faith, and conversion to God.

Chapter 2
1 I what manner the gospel was brought and
  preached to the Thessalonians, and in what sort
  also they received it. 18 A reason is rendered
  both why Saint Paul was so long absent from
  them, and also why he was so desirous to see
  them.

Chapter 3
1 Saint Paul testifieth his great love to the Thes-
  salonians; partly by sending Timothy unto them
  to strengthen and comfort them; partly by re-
  joicing in their well doing; 10 and partly by
  praying for them, and desiring a safe coming
  unto them.

Chapter 4
1 He exhorteth them to go on forward in all manner
  of godliness, 6 to live holily, and justly, 9 to love
  one another, 11 and quietly to follow their own
  business; 13 and last of all, to sorrow moderately
  for the dead. 15 And unto this last exhortation
  is annexed a brief description of the resurrection,
  and second coming of Christ to judgement.

Chapter 5
1 He proceedeth in the former description of Christ's
  coming to judgement, 16 and giveth divers pre-
  cepts, 23 and so concludeth the epistle.

(2 Thessalonians)

Chapter 1
1 Saint Paul certifieth them of the good opinion
  which he had of their faith, love, and patience;
  11 and therewithal useth divers reasons for the
  comforting them in persecution, whereof the
  chiefest is taken from the righteous judgement of
  God.

Chapter 2
1 He willeth them to continue stedfast in the truth
  received; 3 sheweth that there shall be a de-
  parture from the faith, 8 and a discovery of
  antichrist, before the day of the Lord come:
  15 and thereupon repeateth his former exhorta-
  tion, and prayeth for them.

Chapter 3
1 He craveth their prayers for himself, 3 testifieth
  what confidence he hath in them, 5 maketh
  request to God in their behalf, 6 giveth them
  divers precepts, especially to shun idleness and ill
  company; 16 and last of all, concludeth with
  prayer and salutation.

(1 Timothy)

Chapter 1
2 Timothy is put in mind of the charge which was
  given unto him by Paul, at his going to Mace-
  donia. 5 Of the right use and end of the law.
  11 Of Saint Paul's calling to be an apostle: 20
  and of Hymeneus and Alexander.

Chapter 2
1 That it is meet to pray and give thanks for all
  men, and the reason why. 9 How women shall
  be attired: 12 they are not permitted to teach:
  15 they shall be saved, notwithstanding the
  testimonies of God's wrath, in childbirth, if they
  continue in faith.

Chapter 3
2 How bishops, and deacons, and their wives,
  should be qualified; 14 and to what end Saint
  Paul wrote to Timothy of these things. 15 Of
  the church, and the blessed truth therein taught
  and professed.

Chapter 4
1 He foretelleth that in the latter times there shall
  be a departure from the faith. 6 And to the end
  that Timothy might not fail in doing his duty,
  he furnisheth him with divers precepts belonging
  thereto.

Chapter 5
1 Rules to be observed in reproving. 3 Of widows.
  17 Of elders. 23 A precept for Timothy's
  health. 24 Some men's sins go before unto judge-
  ment, and some men's do follow after.

Chapter 6
1 Of the duty of servants. 3 Not to have fellow-
  ship with new fangled teachers. 6 Godliness is
  great gain: 10 and love of money the root of
  all evil. 11 What Timothy is to flee, and what
  to follow; 17 and whereof to admonish the rich.
  20 To keep the purity of true doctrine, and to
  avoid profane janglings.

(2 Timothy)

Chapter 1
1 Paul's love to Timothy, and the unfeigned faith which
  was in Timothy himself, his mother, and grand-
  mother: 6 he is exhorted to stir up the gift of God
  which was in him, 8 to be stedfast and patient
  in persecution, 13 and to persist in the form and
  truth of that doctrine which he had learned of him.
  15 Phygellus and Hermogenes, and such like are
  noted, and Onesiphorus is highly commended.

Chapter 2
1 He is exhorted again to constancy and perse-
  verance, and to do the duty of a faithful ser-
  vant of the Lord in dividing the word aright,
  and shunning profane and vain babblings. 17
  Of Hymeneus and Philetus. 19 The foundation
  of the Lord is sure. 22 He is taught whereof
  to beware, and what to follow after, and in
  what sort the servant of the Lord ought to be-
  have himself.

Chapter 3
1 He advertiseth him of the times to come, 6 de-
  scribeth the enemies of the truth, 10 propoundeth
  unto him his own example, 16 and commendeth
  the holy scriptures.

Chapter 4
1 He exhorteth him to do his duty with all care
  and diligence; 6 certifieth him of the nearness of
  his death; 9 willeth him to come speedily unto
  him, and to bring Marcus with him, and certain
  other things which he wrote for; 14 warneth
  him to beware of Alexander the smith; 16 in-
  formeth him what had befallen him at his first
  answering: 19 and soon after he concludeth.

(Titus)

Chapter 1
5 For what end Titus was left in Crete. 6
  How they that are to be chosen ministers, ought
  to be qualified. 11 The mouths of evil teachers
  to be stopped: 12 and what manner of men
  they be.

Chapter 2
1 Directions given unto Titus both for his doctrine
  and life. 9 Of the duty of servants, and in
  general of all Christians.

Chapter 3
1 Titus is yet further directed by Paul, both con-
  cerning the things he should teach, and not
  teach: 10 he is willed also to reject obstinate
  hereticks: 12 which done, he appointeth him
  both time and place, wherein he should come
  unto him; and so concludeth.

(Philemon)

Chapter 1
4 He rejoiceth to hear of the faith and love of
  Philemon: 9 whom he desireth to forgive his ser-
  vant Onesimus, and lovingly to receive him again.

(Hebrews)

Chapter 1
1 Christ in these last times coming to us from the
  Father, 4 is preferred above the angels, both in
  person and office.

Chapter 2
1 We ought to be obedient to Christ Jesus, 5 and
  that because he vouchsafed to take our nature
  upon him, 14 as it was necessary.

Chapter 3
1 Christ is more worthy than Moses: 7 therefore
  if we believe not in him, we shall be more worthy
  of punishment than hardhearted Israel.

Chapter 4
1 The rest of Christians is attained by faith. 12
  The power of God's word. 14 By our high
  Priest Jesus the Son of God, subject to infirmi-
  ties, but not to sin, 16 we must and may go
  boldly to the throne of grace.

Chapter 5
1 The authority and honour of our Saviour's
  priesthood: 11 negligence in the knowledge
  thereof is reproved.

Chapter 6
1 He exhorteth not to fall back from the faith,
  11 but to be stedfast, 12 diligent and patient to
  wait upon God, 13 because God is most sure in
  his promise.

Chapter 7
1 Christ Jesus is a priest after the order of Melchi-
  sedec, 11 and so far more excellent than the
  priest of Aaron's order.

Chapter 8
1 By the eternal priesthood of Christ, the Levitical
  priesthood of Aaron is abolished; 7 and the tem-
  poral covenant with the fathers, by the eternal
  covenant of the gospel.

Chapter 9
1 The rites and bloody sacrifices of the law, 11
  far inferior to the dignity and perfection of the
  blood and sacrifice of Christ.

Chapter 10
1 The weakness of the law sacrifices. 10 The
  sacrifice of Christ's body once offered, 14 for
  ever hath taken away sins. 19 An exhortation
  to hold fast the faith, with patience and thanks-
  giving.

Chapter 11
1 What faith is. 6 Without faith we cannot
  please God. 7 The worthy fruits thereof in the
  fathers of old time.

Chapter 12
1 An exhortation to constant faith, patience, and
  godliness. 22 A commendation of the new testa-
  ment above the old.

Chapter 13
1 Divers admonitions, as to charity, 4 to honest
  life, 5 to avoid covetousness, 7 to regard God's
  preachers, 9 to take heed of strange doctrines,
  10 to confess Christ, 16 to give alms, 17 to
  obey governors, 18 to pray for the apostles. 20
  The conclusion.

(James)

Chapter 1
1 We are to rejoice under the cross, 5 to ask wis-
  dom of God, 13 and in our trials not to impute
  our weakness, or sins unto him, 19 but rather
  to hearken to the word, to meditate in it, and to
  do thereafter: 26 otherwise men may seem, but
  never be truly religious.

Chapter 2
1 It is not agreeable to the Christian profession to
  regard the rich, and to despise the poor brethren?
  13 rather we are to be loving and merciful;
  14 and not to boast of faith where no deeds are:
  17 which is but a dead faith, 19 the faith of
  devils, 21 not of Abraham, 25 and Rahab.

Chapter 3
1 We are not rashly or arrogantly to reprove others,
  5 but rather to bridle the tongue, a little mem-
  ber, but a powerful instrument of much good,
  and great harm. 13 They who be truly wise,
  be mild, and peaceable, without envying and
  strife.

Chapter 4
1 We are to strive against covetousness, 4 intem-
  perance, 5 pride, 11 detraction and rash judge-
  ment of others: 13 and not to be confident in
  the good success of worldly business; but mindful
  ever of the uncertainty of this life, to commit
  ourselves and all our affairs to God's providence.

Chapter 5
1 Wicked rich men are to fear God's vengeance.
  7 We ought to be patient in afflictions, after
  the example of the prophets and Job; 12 to
  forbear swearing; 13 to pray in adversity, to
  sing in prosperity; 16 to acknowledge mutually
  our several faults, to pray one for another; 19
  and to reduce a straying brother to the truth.

(1 Peter)

Chapter 1
1 He blesseth God for his manifold spiritual graces,
  10 shewing that the salvation in Christ is no
  news, but a thing prophesied of old: 13 and
  exhorteth them accordingly to a godly conversa-
  tion, forasmuch as they are now born anew by
  the word of God.

Chapter 2
1 He dehorteth them from the breach of charity;
  4 shewing that Christ is the foundation whereon
  they are built: 11 he beseecheth them also to
  abstain from fleshly lusts; 13 to be obedient to
  magistrates; 18 and teacheth servants how to
  obey their masters, 20 patiently suffering for
  well doing, after the example of Christ.

Chapter 3
1 He teacheth the duty of wives and husbands to
  each other: 8 exhorting all men to unity and love,
  14 and to suffer persecution: 19 he declareth
  also the benefits of Christ toward the old world.

Chapter 4
1 He exhorteth them to cease from sin by the example
  of Christ, and the consideration of the general
  end that now approacheth; 12 and comforteth
  them against persecution.

Chapter 5
1 He exhorteth the elders to feed their flocks; 5 the
  younger to obey; 8 and all, to be sober, watchful,
  and constant in the faith; 9 to resist the cruel
  adversary the devil.

(2 Peter)

Chapter 1
1 Confirming them in hope of the increase of God's
  graces, 5 he exhorteth them by faith and good
  works, to make their calling sure: 12 whereof
  he is careful to remember them, knowing that
  his death is at hand; 16 warneth them to
  be constant in the faith of Christ, who is the true
  Son of God, by the eyewitness of the apostles be-
  holding his majesty, and by the testimony of the
  Father and the prophets.

Chapter 2
1 He foretelleth them of false teachers, shewing the
  impiety and punishment both of them and their
  followers; 7 from which the godly shall be de-
  livered, as Lot was out of Sodom: 10 and more
  fully describeth the manners of those profane and
  blasphemous seducers, whereby they may be the
  better known, and avoided.

Chapter 3
1 He assureth them of the certainty of Christ's coming
  to judgement, opposing those scorners who dispute
  against it; 8 warning the godly for the long pa-
  tience of God, to hasten their repentance: 10 he
  describeth also the manner how the world shall be
  destroyed; 11 exhorting them from the expecta-
  tion thereof to all holiness of life; 15 and again,
  to think the patience of God to tend to their sal-
  vation, as Paul wrote to them in his epistles.

(1 John)

Chapter 1
1 He describeth the person of Christ, in whom we
  have eternal life by a communion with God: 5
  to which we must adjoin hooliness of life, to testify
  the truth of that our communion and profession
  of faith, as also to assure us of the forgiveness
  of our sins by Christ's death.

Chapter 2
1 He comforteth them against the sins of infirmity.
  3 Rightly to know God, is to keep his command-
  ments, 9 to love our brethren, 15 and not to
  love the world. 18 We must beware of se-
  ducers: 20 from whose deceits the godly are
  safe preserved by perseverance in faith, and
  holiness of life.

Chapter 3
1 He declareth the singular love of God toward
  us, in making us his sons; 3 who therefore ought
  obediently to keep his commandments, 11 as also
  brotherly to love one another.

Chapter 4
1 He warneth them not to believe all teachers who
  boast of the Spirit, but to try them by the rules
  of the catholick faith: 7 and by many reasons
  exhorteth to brotherly love.

Chapter 5
1 He that loveth God, loveth his children, and
  keepeth his commandments; 3 which to the
  faithful are light, and not grievous. 9 Jesus
  is the Son of God, able to save us, 14 and to
  hear our prayers, which we make for ourselves,
  and for others.

(2 John)

Chapter 1
1 He exhorteth a certain honourable matron with
  her children, to presevere in Christian love and
  belief, 8 lest they lose the reward of their former
  profession; 10 and to have nothing to do with
  those seducers that bring not the true doctrine of
  Christ Jesus.

(3 John)

Chapter 1
1 He commendeth Gaius for his piety, 5 and hos-
  pitality, 7 to true preachers; 9 complaining
  of the unkind dealing of ambitious Diotrephes on
  the contrary side, 11 whose evil example is not
  to be followed: 12 and giveth special testimony
  to the good report of Demetrius.

(Jude)

Chapter 1
1 He exhorteth them to be constant in the profession
  of the faith. 4 False teachers are crept in to
  seduce them; for whose damnable doctrine and
  manners, horrible punishment is prepared: 20
  whereas the godly by the assistance of the Holy
  Spirit, and prayers to God, may persevere and
  grow in grace, and keep themselves, and recover
  others out of the snares of those deceivers.

(Revelation)

Chapter 1
4 John writeth his revelation to the seven churches
  of Asia, signified by the seven golden candlesticks.
  7 The coming of Christ: 14 his glorious power
  and majesty.

Chapter 2
What is commanded to be written to the angels
  (that is, the ministers) of the churches of 1
  Ephesus, 8 Smyrna, 12 Pergamos, 18 Thya-
  tira: and what is commended, or found wanting
  in them.

Chapter 3
1 The angel of the church of Sardis is reproved,
  3 exhorted to repent, and threatened if he do
  not repent. 8 The angel of the church of Phi-
  ladelphia, 10 is approved for his diligence and
  patience. 15 The angel of Laodicea is rebuked,
  for being neither hot nor cold, 19 and admonished
  to be more zealous. 20 Christ standeth at the
  door, and knocketh.

Chapter 4
2 John seeth the throne of God in heaven. 4 The
  four and twenty elders. 6 The four beasts full
  of eyes before and behind. 10 The elders lay
  down their crowns, and worship him that sat on
  the throne.

Chapter 5
1 The book sealed with seven seals: 9 which only
  the Lamb that was slain is worthy to open. 12
  Therefore the elders praise him, 9 and confess
  that he redeemed them with his blood.

Chapter 6
The opening of the seals in order, and what fol-
  lowed thereupon; containing a prophecy to the
  end of the world.

Chapter 7
3 An angel sealeth the servants of God in their
  foreheads. 4 The number of them that were
  sealed: of the tribes of Israel a certain num-
  ber, 9 of all other nations an innumerable
  multitude which stand before the throne, clad
  in white robes, and palms in their hands.
  14 Their robes were washed in the blood of
  the Lamb.

Chapter 8
1 At the opening of the seventh seal, 2 seven angels
  had seven trumpets given them: 3 another angel
  putteth incense to the prayers of the saints on
  the golden altar. 6 Four angels sound their
  trumpets, and great plagues follow.

Chapter 9
1 At the sounding of the fifth angel, a star falleth
  from heaven, to whom is given the key of the
  bottomless pit: 2 he openeth the pit, and there
  come forth locusts like scorpions. 12 The first
  woe past. 13 The sixth trumpet sounded. 14
  Four angels are let loose, that were bound.

Chapter 10
1 A mighty strong angel appeareth with a book
  open in his hand: 6 he sweareth by him that
  liveth for ever, that there shall be no more
  time. 9 John is commanded to take and eat
  the book.

Chapter 11
3 The two witnesses prophesy: 6 they have power
  to shut heaven, that it rain not: 7 the beasts
  shall fight against them, and kill them: 8 they
  lie unburied, 11 and after three days and an
  half rise again. 14 The second woe is past. 15
  The seventh trumpet soundeth.

Chapter 12
1 A woman clothed with the sun travaileth: 4 the
  great red dragon standeth before her, ready to
  devour her child. 6 When she was delivered,
  she fleeth into the wilderness. 7 Michael and
  his angels fight with the dragon, and prevail.
  13 The dragon being cast down unto the earth,
  persecuteth the woman.

Chapter 13
1 A beast riseth out of the sea with seven heads and
  ten horns, to whom the dragon giveth his power.
  11 Another beast cometh up out of the earth; 14
  causeth an image to be made of the former beast,
  15 and that men should worship it, 16 and re-
  ceive his mark.

Chapter 14
1 The Lamb standing on mount Sion with his com-
  pany; 6 an angel preacheth the gospel. 8 The
  fall of Babylon. 15 The harvest of the world,
  and putting in of the sickle. 20 The vintage
  and winepress of the wrath of God.

Chapter 15
1 The seven angels with the seven last plagues. 3
  The song of them that overcome the beast. 7 The
  seven vials full of the wrath of God.

Chapter 16
1 The angels pour out their vials full of wrath.
  6 The plagues that follow thereupon. 15 Christ
  cometh as a thief. Blessed are they that watch.

Chapter 17
3, 4 A woman arrayed in purple and scarlet, with
  a golden cup in her hand, sitteth upon the beast,
  5 which is great Babylon, the mother of all abo-
  minations. 9 The interpretation of the seven
  heads, 12 and the ten horns. 14 The victory of
  the Lamb. 16 The punishment of the whore.

Chapter 18
2 Babylon is fallen. 4 The people of God commanded
  to depart out of her. 9 The kings of the earth,
  11 with the merchants and mariners, lament over
  her. 20 The saints rejoice for the judgements
  of God upon her.

Chapter 19
1 God is praised in heaven for judging the great
  whore, and avanging the blood of his saints.
  7 The marriage of the Lamb. 10 The angel
  will not be worshipped. 17 The fowls called to
  the great slaughter.

Chapter 20
2 Satan bound for a thousand years. 5 The first
  resurrection: 6 they blessed that have part
  therein. 7 Satan let loose again. 8 Gog and
  Magog. 10 The devil cast into the lake of fire and
  brimstone. 12 The last and general resurrection.

Chapter 21
1 A new heaven and a new earth. 10 The hea-
  venly Jerusalem, with a full description there-
  of: 23 she needeth no sun, the glory of God is
  her light: 24 the kings of the earth bring their
  riches unto her.

Chapter 22
1 The river of the water of life. 2 The tree of
  life. 5 The light of the city of God is himself.
  9 The angel will not be worshipped. 18 No-
  thing may be added to the word of God, nor
  taken therefrom.

THE END
